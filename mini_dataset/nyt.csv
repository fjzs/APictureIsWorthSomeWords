8279,"BERLIN — The German government is negotiating with Jewish representatives to ensure that the thousands of poorest and weakest Holocaust survivors worldwide receive the intensive care they need to live out their final years at home.
 The German Finance Ministry and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany continue to hold regular talks but the effort to reach an agreement has taken on a new sense of urgency, because the youngest of those needing full-time care are already in their 80s — and many others are over 100 years old.
 With an estimated 100,000 Holocaust victims living in the United States, roughly a fifth of survivors worldwide, their plight has raised concern in Congress, and on Thursday representatives introduced a resolution calling on the German government to do more.
 Representatives Ted Deutch, a Democrat, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, both from Florida, submitted the resolution to the House asking Germany to “recognize the imperative of immediately and fully funding victims’ medical, mental health, and long-term care needs and to do so with full transparency and accountability to ensure all funds for Holocaust victims.” A companion resolution was introduced in the Senate.
 The German Finance Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
 The Claims Conference cares for 55,000 survivors in dozens of countries around the world through compensation and reparations programs financed by the German government that began more than 60 years ago.
 But as they age, Holocaust survivors face increasing special-care needs, linked to the persecution they suffered and the isolation resulting from the loss of family members in the Holocaust.
 The current round of talks, which opened in January and is scheduled to end by June, is trying to find a way to meet those needs, said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference.
 The German government currently provides compensation for survivors to be cared for in their homes for up to 25 hours per week, based on an assessment of an individual’s need.
 In many cases, however, that is not enough, leaving mentally and physically frail or forgetful survivors without anyone to look after them over the weekend, or throughout the night.
 A central element of the negotiations is to move away from weekly caps on hours and to create a more flexible system.
 German officials have cautioned that for such a plan to be effective, they need to assess what needs are not being met and to structure a program based on a budget that would pay for in-home care of the neediest cases over the next five to seven years.
 Among the most acute cases are those who suffer from a loss of memory compounded by the emotional triggers that affect many victims.
 As their memories fail, they often recall their younger lives, when they may have been forced from their homes, crowded into cattle cars and ripped from their parents, whom in most cases they would never see again.
 “When you are a Holocaust survivor and regress, what you are going back to is darkest point of human history,” Mr. Schneider said.
 He gave the example of a woman in the program with dementia who requires full-time care. Although she still lives with her husband, who also survived the Holocaust, every time he tries to leave their home she starts to scream, “Don’t go! They will take you away, they will get you!”
 “She is living in a world where the Nazis are still there,” Mr. Schneider said.
 In response to a congressional letter written to Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble in December, Jens Spahn, a deputy minister who is leading the negotiations on behalf of the German government, said his country recognized that current levels of care were “insufficient for those in need of intensive long-term care.”
 “Some survivors require more extensive care, in some cases full-time care,” Mr. Spahn wrote in the letter.
 Germany has made payments worth more than 73.4 billion euros, about $83 billion, in reparations and compensation, mostly to Jewish victims of the Nazis. The assistance to aging survivors is only a small part of these contributions.
 “Many of my constituents are in their 80s, 90s, even 100, and our focus is ensuring that their needs can be provided for,” Mr. Deutch said.
 “I’ve been trying to help survivors since coming to Congress six years ago,” he said. “While we acknowledge that what is being done by the Germans is incredibly generous, survivors’ needs are not being met.”

7840,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Women’s sports programs in Afghanistan, long a favorite of Western donors, have all but collapsed.
 Some consist of little more than a young woman with a business card and a desk, as one insider described the women’s version of cricket, Afghanistan’s most popular game. Others, like women’s soccer, have managed to field a few teams for practices and training sessions but have not played an international match in years.
 Even the relatively few encouraging stories, like women’s taekwondo, one of the sports that may see an Afghan woman sent to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, are at best qualified successes. Afghanistan’s strongest hope for a female taekwondo medalist, Somaya Ghulami, 23, actually lives in Iran and commutes to practice sessions here. She said she would never be able to compete if she had to live in her own country.
 It is a conspicuous failure for Western efforts to improve the lives of Afghan women. With few exceptions, the sports programs have become riddled with corruption and been undermined by conservative Afghans who have never liked the idea of young women on sports fields.
 One of the main supporters of women’s sports in Afghanistan is the American government, which spends $1.5 million a year on coeducational sports programs — not counting a $450,000 cricket grant that officials took back when they realized no women’s cricket was being played. American officials, however, declined to discuss women’s sports on the record.
 While all women’s sports here are suffering, none have failed quite as spectacularly as the women’s national cycling team. Celebrated in documentaries, and the subject of a 2014 book and a blizzard of news articles, the team was recently nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize — thanks to the tireless promotion of its benefactor, Shannon Galpin, who financed the team through her Colorado-based charity, Mountain to Mountain.
 However, Ms. Galpin announced on her web page last month that she would no longer support the Afghan Cycling Federation because of what she described as “out of control” corruption by the team’s longtime coach and the head of the federation, Haji Abdul Sediq Seddiqi.
 Ms. Galpin was upset that sponsors’ gifts, including more than 40 bicycles and other racing gear, valued at more than $100,000, were stolen after being handed over by her organization to the team and Mr. Seddiqi.
 Mr. Seddiqi was recently dismissed from his post as both coach and head of the federation by the president of the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee, Mohammad Zaher Aghbar, who cited something besides corruption. He claimed that Mr. Seddiqi had successively married and divorced three of the young women on his team. “He has married three of them — three times — and the girls were all complaining about him,” Mr. Aghbar said.
 In an interview, Mr. Seddiqi denied the corruption charges, claimed Ms. Galpin’s organization was still financing the cycling federation and called the accusations against him “a lot of made-up crap.” Mr. Seddiqi, 62, acknowledged that he had three prior divorces and was now married to a 25-year-old woman, but denied that his current or past wives were ever team members.
 One national cycling champion (Mr. Seddiqi also controlled the men’s team), Hashmat Barakzai, who recently fled to Germany to claim asylum, said that “Seddiqi used the women’s team as his personal piggy bank and love playground.”
 Mr. Seddiqi’s critics said training was almost nonexistent. “He would take them out to a roundabout on the highway and ride around in circles,” Ms. Galpin said.
 “Under coach,” Ms. Galpin said, referring to Mr. Seddiqi, “it’s zero female empowerment.”
 Corruption in other women’s sports might not be quite as brazen, but it remains a huge problem. Diana Barakzai, who played for Afghanistan’s women’s cricket team when it was actually functioning, in 2009, said she was approached recently by the Afghanistan Cricket Board about heading up a women’s team.
 “They told me they already made a deal with someone to pay them $180,000 for the job, but if you’re willing to pay $200,000 you can have it,” she said, adding that she turned the offer down.
 Ms. Barakzai, who is not related to Mr. Barakzai, said she was surprised by the demand, since she assumed there was no money to be made in women’s cricket. Besides, the national team had not competed — or even practiced — in at least three years.
 But it turned out that the United States Embassy had awarded a grant of $450,000 last summer to promote women’s cricket and had sent it to Lapis Communications, a private organization, to administer. Those funds have now been returned to the American Embassy, said a Lapis official, Sarah-Jean Cunningham. “This program did not get the traction it needed to justify pushing forward,” she said.
 Shafiq Stanikzai, the chief executive officer of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, denied Ms. Barakzai’s accusations. “That’s totally a false claim that she made and a very stupid one,” he said.
 Mr. Stanikzai said that there was a national women’s cricket program but that it was operating in secret. “We are not publicizing that due to certain limitations,” he said. “The national team is functioning but at a very basic level, as they are not good enough to compete at an international level.”
 But Peter Anderson, an Australian cricket coach who was brought to Afghanistan several years ago to train its women’s cricket team, said the cricket board was so against women participating that it had dismantled what women’s team there was. He said he quit after being shunted to coaching the disabled team.
 Tuba Sangar is the current head of women’s cricket — the person Mr. Anderson described as “a girl in an office with a business card.” When contacted, she said she was not allowed to comment.
 Robina Jalali was on the first women’s team to compete in 2004 in the Olympics for Afghanistan after the Taliban were toppled. A runner, she was one of two at the 2004 Games. Now the head of women’s sports at the National Olympic Committee, she says that even the foreign embassies are no longer paying much attention.
 “The main problem is the growing insecurity we have; secondly, violence against women, which is growing. Women are not feeling safe to train,” she said. “Now we see the youth are just running away from the country, which has changed the mentality of the embassies,” she continued. “They feel they can’t give a girl a visa to compete because she’s not going to come back.”
 But the women’s soccer team, often held up as an example of success, has not played internationally since 2014. There are plans to do so sometime this year, yet neither the date nor the country where it will take place has been set, said Khatool Shahzad, an official with the soccer federation.
 Shamila Kohestani is a women’s soccer success story, going from captain of the women’s team in 2007 to a scholarship at Drew University in New Jersey. Her dream had been to return here as a coach, but after a recent visit to Kabul she decided not to.
 Ms. Kohestani thinks that Afghan officials never really supported the idea of women in sports, saying they only feigned interest because women’s sports were such grant magnets. “They would say, ‘I would never let my daughter do that,’” she said. “They treated us like sluts or something because we’re running around showing ourselves to men.”
 The women’s soccer team still exists, mainly because the players are encouraged to participate by what for Afghanistan are generous cash payments: $100 a month for national team members and $50 for junior team members.
 Despite that incentive, only 10 national team members out of 22 (the women play 11-a-side soccer) came out for a recent two-hour practice; their coach, a man, did not show up at all.
 The team captain, Forozan Tajali, 22, took over the training session. She said security concerns, family pressure and public harassment were not the only difficulties the soccer players faced. The national team has lost more members to marriage than anything else, she said, because Afghan women are considered too old to wed after their early 20s, and their husbands typically refuse to allow them to play.
 Taekwondo has been similarly hurt, Ms. Ghulami said during a recent training session here, adding, “Fortunately, I have a liberal family that does support me — and we live in Iran.”

6097,"With Donald Trump’s unfavorable ratings at record levels, the Republican Party’s prospects for taking back the White House already seem bleak. But its chances may be even worse yet. The doubts Mr. Trump has raised during his primary campaign also undermine the strongest rationale for any Republican candidate in this election: the need for new leadership after eight years of Democratic control of the White House.
 The Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz highlights this factor in his “time for a change” forecasting model of presidential election outcomes. “When a party has held the White House for two or more terms,” he writes, “voters will be more likely to feel that it is time to give the opposing party an opportunity to govern than when a party has held the White House for only one term.”
 Mr. Abramowitz finds that the party in power performs approximately five percentage points worse in the popular vote after two or more terms in office in a model that controls for the current president’s approval rating and the state of the economy. The sample size of post-World War II elections is very small, but Mr. Abramowitz’s model dominates the field in its forecasting accuracy.
 Both Mr. Abramowitz’s model and a similar one from the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck (an Upshot contributor) would characterize Republicans as the favorite in this election with an estimated probability of winning of approximately 60 percent. As Mr. Sides notes, the G.O.P. edge is due in large part “to the White House’s greater tendency to change hands the longer the incumbent party has been there.”
 But these forecasts are made based on simple models that do not include any information about the nominees (and implicitly assume, as Mr. Abramowitz notes, that the parties select mainstream candidates). In contrast, betting and prediction markets that take the likely party nominees into account put Mr. Trump’s chances of winning in November at approximately 25 percent.
 Why, then, is Mr. Trump looking so likely to underperform in November? Even his unfavorability ratings may not fully explain his diminished chances. Candidates who are initially not seen as personally likable can overcome those perceptions, as Bill Clinton did in 1992, another “time for a change” election (though Mr. Trump’s ratings are worse, and he has been known for longer at the national level).
 For instance, consider a counterfactual situation in which Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump’s chief rival, became the nominee. Mr. Cruz also had high unfavorable numbers before dropping out of the race, but if he had won the G.O.P. nomination under normal circumstances, most Republicans would have probably rallied around him (as they did around Mitt Romney in 2012), and the electorate would have eventually come to see him somewhat less negatively.
 In Mr. Trump’s case, his reputation for irresponsibility and lack of political experience overshadow the “time for a change” message. He frequently calls for new leadership — a message that would normally be the strongest G.O.P. appeal in an election year when the economy is not weak enough to be the focus of the opposition’s campaign. But instead of being a referendum on the incumbent party’s failures, this election seems likely to turn on how voters view Mr. Trump himself. Many voters who might have been open to an alternative after eight years of President Obama will instead ponder whether it is too risky to vote for Mr. Trump, especially after Mrs. Clinton makes his qualifications the central message of her campaign.
 Mr. Trump could still win, but he will have to find some way to turn the focus back to Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats and to convince voters that the change in leadership he represents is desirable.

3173,"CULVER CITY, Calif. — A day after offering a forceful denunciation of Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton on Friday expressed hope that she was only days away from putting the long-running Democratic nominating fight behind her.
 “If all goes well, I will have the great honor as of Tuesday to be the Democratic nominee for president,” she said at a rally featuring a lengthy lineup of well-known actresses, including Sally Field, Debra Messing, Elizabeth Banks, Sophia Bush and Mary Steenburgen.
 Mrs. Clinton is expected to secure enough delegates on Tuesday to become the party’s presumptive nominee, probably before the polls close in California, one of the six states with nominating contests that day.
 The moment cannot come soon enough for Mrs. Clinton, who has already turned her attention to Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, attacking him on a variety of subjects at campaign events, while almost never mentioning her remaining Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
 But Mr. Sanders has proved to be a formidable opponent in California, and the primary here Tuesday is expected to be close, even if its importance is symbolic, given Mrs. Clinton’s wide lead in delegates.
 In her final campaign swing in California before the primary, Mrs. Clinton turned on Friday to some celebrities to give her a boost.
 In a gym at West Los Angeles College, the D.J. Samantha Ronson handled the music, and a procession of actresses spoke in support of Mrs. Clinton and skewered Mr. Trump.
 “He ran a university, it no longer exists,” Ms. Banks said. “He had a TV show, it no longer exists. He had hair. …” She let those words linger, and the crowd laughed.
 Ms. Messing warned that if Mr. Trump became president, “We will be a country led by a reckless bigot and misogynist.” Ms. Bush said Mr. Trump wanted “to make our country a fearful reality show contest.”
 And Ms. Field questioned why Mrs. Clinton had been criticized as unlikable, asking, “What is this, a high school popularity contest?” She said that Mrs. Clinton was “not running to be everybody’s friend.”
 “Women have spent the last hundred years trying to get out from under the expectation that they had to be sugar and spice and everything nice,” Ms. Field said. “We don’t need sugar and spice and everything nice.”
 Mrs. Clinton did not use up all her available star power at Friday’s event. The actress Jamie Lee Curtis joined her at a rally in California last week, and the singer Jon Bon Jovi spoke at a rally on Wednesday in New Jersey, which also votes next week.
 And in Los Angeles on Monday, she will hold a fund-raising concert featuring Christina Aguilera, Andra Day, John Legend, Ricky Martin and Stevie Wonder.
 At the rally on Friday, Mrs. Clinton brought up her speech the day before, in which she declared that Mr. Trump was unfit to be commander in chief and said that electing him would be a “historic mistake.”
 Mr. Trump later wrote on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton “made up things” in her speech. But Mrs. Clinton told the crowd on Friday that she simply repeated “what Donald Trump has said.”
 “I didn’t make any of that up,” she said. “I mean, it would be hard to make up. And by the end of working on that speech, even I was saying, ‘Did he really say all of this?’ Well, indeed he did.”

3497,"Recently, I lost a day at work when my Upshot colleague Austin Frakt emailed me first thing in the morning to tell me that headlines were appearing declaring that an “explosive new cellphone-cancer” study was making the rounds. As I have long been interested in this topic, I started to read the headlines and news.
 “Cellphone-Cancer Link Seen in Rat Study,” said Time. “Cellphone Radiation Linked to Cancer in Major Rat Study,” said IEEE Spectrum, a magazine for engineers. I was dismayed to say the least. “Game-changing,” as a quotation in a Mother Jones headline put it, seemed like a bit of an overreach.
 So I went ahead and read the paper. Despite what some outlets reported, this was a not-yet-published study of rats that had been shopped for “review,” but had not been accepted by any editors. It detailed a study that examined if exposing rats to radiation like that emitted by cellphones might give them cancer.
 The researchers first exposed pregnant rats to whole body CDMA- or GSM-modulated radio frequency radiation for nine hours a day, every day of the week. Once these rats gave birth, the researchers took pups of each sex and set them up in groups exposed to both types of radiation at three different levels. At the end of the study, they found that male rats had a statistically significant (p<0.05) higher rate of glioma, a brain tumor, and cardiac schwannomas, a nerve tumor in the heart, in the CDMA-exposed groups.
 There were no differences in brain tumors in the GSM-exposed rats. There were no differences seen in female rats. There were no differences seen in schwannomas in other locations than the heart in any rats.
 This, evidently, was enough for many news media outlets to proclaim that “the debate had been reignited” and that “your cellphone could kill you.” That’s not what the study said at all.
 Let’s begin with the fact that this is a rat study and that we shouldn’t jump to the conclusion that what happens with rats and cancer is what happens in humans. That’s burned us before.
 It’s also odd that increased cancer was seen only in male rats and not in female rats. Do we believe that females are protected from cellphone radiation?
 Oddly, the male rats in the control group lived much shorter lives than expected. Do we believe that cellphone radiation exposure makes rats live longer? The rate of cancer in the exposed rats was actually in line with what you’d expect in rats in general. It’s the controls that had oddly low rates of cancer. Do we believe that the control rats were somehow cured of cancer?
 The answer to all of these questions is, of course, no. But headlines blaring those results would be just as valid as those we saw last week.
 The shortened life span in the control rats is a real problem, too. If it turns out that these cancers develop later in life, then their dying early could be responsible for all the significant results of the study.
 Given the small number of rats in the study, the many comparisons done, and the low rates of cancer overall, we have to be concerned with the validity of the results. When you’re designing research, you need to make sure that you have enough of a sample so that you don’t get a negative result when there really is a difference (a false negative), or a positive result when there really is no difference (a false positive). This study is likely to have a high false discovery rate, or an increased risk of being a false positive.
 You can’t cherry-pick in science, as I’ve discussed before. If you want to own the positive result seen in males, you have to own the protection being female seems to confer. You have to own that the control rats were somehow magically without cancer. You have to own that cellphone exposure increases life span. Or you can admit that none of these results are especially convincing.
 But too often, the news media latch onto one finding while ignoring others. Too often, this finding is the one that’s most frightening, or scariest. It’s certainly the one that seems most likely to get attention.
 No study can be judged in isolation. In this case, taking the results from one arguably imperfect rat study while ignoring others makes no sense. When it comes to cellphones and cancer, a great deal of research already exists.
 Most of that work is what we call case-control studies. To do a study like that, you’d find a group of people with brain tumors (cases) and a group of similar people without brain tumors (controls). Then, you’d get data on them (like “do you use a cellphone?”) to see if differences exist between them.
 Studies like this, though, are susceptible to what we call recall bias. This is where people who have had something bad happen to them are more likely to think hard and remember things, like using a cellphone, than people who have not. Better-designed studies, including cohort studies, have not shown a link between cellphones and cancer.
 Many organizations, such as the American Cancer Society, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Communications Commission and the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks have reviewed the collected research — there is a lot — and found insufficient evidence for a link.
 No new study can be viewed in a vacuum. It must be added to what is already known. Given such a large body of studies, you can’t take one small rat study and say that it’s a “game changer.” It’s nearly impossible for any such study to overcome all that has come before.
 This is especially true because of publication bias. It’s probably much more likely that you’ll get a new study published if you find a link between cellphones and cancer than if you don’t.
 There’s a media bias, too. When published studies have negative results, you often don’t hear about them. When results are positive, especially if they are frightening, they’re talked about as if they’re definitive.
 One more point. All research should be hypothesis-driven, and make sense in the real world. Cellphones are unbelievably common. More than 90 percent of people in the United States use one regularly. If they caused brain cancer in even a small percentage of users, we’d see an increase in its incidence. Since the late 1980s, however, the incidence of brain cancer in the United States has been decreasing.
 Faced with such real-world evidence, anyone should be skeptical about arguments that one causes the other.
 When a new study is published, it must be thoroughly vetted to see how robust its results are. It must be evaluated in light of all other research that exists. It must be considered alongside real-world data to ensure that it makes sense. That’s how we need to think — and report — about new research.

4868,"For the first time in weeks, the most significant news story dominating the cable networks on Thursday was unrelated to the presidential campaign: the disappearance of EgyptAir Flight 804.
 But Hillary Clinton broke through the cable din for an interview on CNN, a day after Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, used the word “rape” to conjure old accusations made against her husband.
 Mrs. Clinton made clear she was not going to join that battle. Instead, she said, voters want to know what the candidates will do for their futures, a bit of a riff on one of her husband’s lines from his 1992 presidential campaign, when his infidelities were raised, about his rivals wanting to focus on the past.
 Mrs. Clinton also made her most vocal case against Mr. Trump, saying he is unqualified for the Oval Office, and declared her Democratic primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont all but settled.
 The former secretary of state is not prone to the staccato-style series of phone and sit-down interviews that Mr. Trump favors, and she has a long way to go to frame a message against him between now and November. Whether the interview signals a new approach remains to be seen.
 As for Mr. Trump, he stayed off the campaign trail on Thursday, although he promoted Paul J. Manafort to chief strategist, the highest position one can hold on a campaign. On Friday, Mr. Trump will be in Kentucky, appearing at a National Rifle Association conference.

6890,"BALTIMORE — Manager Joe Girardi was midway through another dispiriting postmortem, speaking to reporters outside the visitors’ clubhouse, when the dark blue backdrop with the logos of the Yankees and their sponsor began to fall away from the curtain rod from which it hung.
 It was a fitting epitaph for another frustrating night in a young season that has been filled with them, as the Yankees were beaten by the Baltimore Orioles, 4-1, on Tuesday night.
 It was the Yankees’ sixth straight defeat, and perhaps not the only loss they suffered. In the fifth inning, Alex Rodriguez left clutching his hamstring after running out a ground ball. He will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday morning to determine the extent of the injury.
 “I don’t know how bad it is,” Girardi said. “It’s definitely worrisome. He just started swinging the bat, too.”
 That tone of weariness is becoming a familiar one for the Yankees, who once again struggled to do anything more at the plate than hit singles — or string many of them together. It was the 13th time in 24 games that they have not managed more than two runs.
 Luis Severino turned in his best start of the season, but his few mistakes were too much to overcome. He allowed two home runs to Mark Trumbo and dropped two soft tosses from Mark Teixeira while covering first base, the second of which allowed another run to score.
 As he walked back to the mound after the second drop, Severino was patted on the back by Teixeira, a gesture of support and encouragement that the Yankees are finding themselves increasingly needing as they sit in last place in the American League East at 8-16. The last time they were this many games below .500 was in 2007, when they started the season 21-29.
 Before the game, General Manager Brian Cashman tried to direct some of the heat away from his players, coaches and Girardi by accepting blame for the poor start and reiterating that no changes were afoot — for the moment.
 “The reality is, the talent level that we currently have in that clubhouse is good enough to be a force,” Cashman said. “So we shouldn’t have to be thinking this way. I shouldn’t be sitting in front of you right now having to talk about such an awful April. We left spring training feeling really good about ourselves.”
 Tuesday’s defeat prompted left fielder Brett Gardner to refer to Wednesday’s game as a must win. “We’ve been struggling here for a few weeks,” Gardner said. “I think everybody knows — I guess it’s never a must win in May, but it feels like it. It’s important to us to get things going in the right direction. For whatever reason, it hasn’t happened.”
 The Yankees’ sense of urgency is an unwelcome sign for Girardi, who was asked afterward if there might be any anxiety over games in May that suddenly have the importance usually reserved for contests in August or September.
 “Anxiety?” Girardi said. “You cannot be anxious for anything. It does you no good. I think the players are frustrated. I think they come prepared every day and they expect good things to happen, and right now they’re not happening. But that will turn around.”
 The Yankees trotted out their usual lineup and looked little different from the way they have all season. The seven runs they posted Sunday night in an 8-7 loss at Boston looked like an aberration as the night wore on.
 Their only run came in the second when Didi Gregorius grounded a two-out single up the middle, scoring Brian McCann. A potentially robust inning had been undercut one batter earlier, when Starlin Castro grounded into a double play.
 The Yankees put runners on in each of the first six innings, but every half-threat petered out. The only extra-base hit was Gardner’s double off the right-field wall in the first. And a promising start to the sixth, in which Teixeira walked and McCann blooped a single to left, soon fizzled. Carlos Beltran lined out to right, and Castro lined into a double play when McCann was caught off first.
 The Yankees struck out nine times against Chris Tillman, who matched his career high. He had entered the game with a 4.96 E.R.A. against the Yankees.
 Rodriguez, who had shown signs of coming alive with two home runs over the weekend in Boston and five R.B.I. on Sunday night, flied out, struck out and grounded out in his three at-bats. It was not clear how long he would be out. He missed two games last week when he tweaked an oblique muscle.
 “It wasn’t a big pop,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve done that before in my career. I’m hoping for the best. Hopefully, it’s just a small setback.”
 But it could be another one that the Yankees find difficult to absorb.

6069,"MCC Theater is best known for its work on contemporary plays, but next year, for only the third time in its history, it will present a musical, and it’s an unusual one: “Ride the Cyclone,” about a group of teenagers making the case for their lives from the Great Beyond after a tragic roller coaster accident.
 The musical, which has been much praised in previous stagings, is a highlight of the next season for MCC.
 The theater is also presenting the American premier of a new dark comedy written by, and starring, Matthew Perry, the actor best known from the television show “Friends.” The play, “The End of Longing,” ran in London, where it was a commercial success but a critical dud; Mr. Perry is reworking the script for the New York run.
 MCC has had a long relationship with the playwright Neil LaBute, and its season will begin in September with a new play by him, “All the Ways to Say I Love You.” The play is a one-woman show, starring Judith Light and directed by Leigh Silverman.
 “Ride the Cyclone,” written by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell, will be directed by Rachel Rockwell, and is to run in November and December. It was previously staged at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and is being supported by a commercial producer, Kevin McCollum.
 MCC will present “Yen,” a play about two teenage brothers that was written by Anna Jordan, with Trip Cullman directing. The play, which was previous presented at the Royal Court Theater in London, will be staged in New York next February.
 “The End of Longing,” in which Mr. Perry plays an alcoholic with a motley collection of friends, features Lindsay Posner as its director and is to open next May.

6689,"BEIJING — Now that China had completed a 10,000-foot runway fit for fighter jets and dredged a huge harbor at Fiery Cross Reef, an artificial island at the center of a territorial dispute in the South China Sea, the time had come to reward the workers who built them.
 One of China’s biggest navy ships, a type of amphibious assault vessel, arrived at Fiery Cross Reef this week loaded with a performance group from the People’s Liberation Army. They danced and sang for two and a half hours before a cheering crowd of military personnel and construction workers.
 A video of the performance by CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, showed the gray hull of the Kunlunshan, a 20,000-ton warship and the second-largest vessel in the Chinese fleet, as the backdrop for the temporary stage rigged up portside.
 One of the most applauded songs of the evening was “This Is the Kind of Man We Want to Marry,” a patriotic ballad about a navy man who postpones his wedding because of his duties far from home. Eventually, the man’s fiancée comes to the island, and they marry on the construction site.
 The audience, dressed in blue military fatigues and hard hats, cheered when the singer onstage delivered the “I do” line.
 An enthusiastic construction worker told a CCTV interviewer, “This is exactly our lives: wife and children waiting for us to come home.” He wore a helmet bearing the name of the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned enterprise specializing in port, airstrip and bridge building.
 “Song and dance is always a way to show gratitude,” said Gary Li, an analyst at APCO Worldwide, a consulting firm on geopolitical affairs. The vessel the performers arrived on was similar to ships used by the United States Marines to carry vehicles, helicopters and troops, he said.
 “The performance was a sign that Fiery Cross Reef is considered a long-term garrison,” Mr. Li said.
 Live theater is not the only distraction for workers and troops on Fiery Cross Reef. Last month, satellite images showed a newly built soccer field and basketball and tennis courts.
 “The football field and tennis courts are all to enrich the spare time of the soldiers who are all young men working there under tough conditions,” said Xu Guangyu, a retired major general. “Now they can even watch television and use mobile phones. Before, we didn’t even have stable radio signals.”
 Fiery Cross Reef, now a 700-acre island where once just a couple of low-lying rocks were lapped by the tides, is the subject of an arbitration case filed by the Philippines at a United Nations tribunal in The Hague.
 A ruling is expected in the coming weeks, and there is wide expectation that the panel will decide that China’s construction in the last 18 months on Fiery Cross Reef and other islands in the Spratly archipelago contravenes international law.
 Before the ruling, China is making various military and diplomatic moves to show that it is standing firm on its claims to seven disputed islands in the Spratlys, about 500 miles from China and less than 150 miles from the Philippines.
 A large-scale Chinese naval exercise will soon be underway in the South China Sea, The People’s Liberation Daily announced on Wednesday.
 This week, three warships from the South Sea Fleet left Hainan Island, the southernmost province of China, for the exercise, and three more will soon join them, the newspaper said. The exercise is intended to “strengthen the combat spirit and foster the concept of war preparation,” it said.

1019,"The massacre in Orlando, Fla., has inspired tearful vigils and neighborly charity. But an act of giving announced on Monday by one Florida lawmaker has spurred denunciations.
 Greg Evers, a Republican state senator who is running for United States Congress, said he would hold a drawing whose prize would be an AR-15, a gun similar to the one used by Omar Mateen to kill 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando on June 12.
 Mr. Evers said that he was considering the giveaway since before the mass shooting, intending to burnish his pro-gun credentials in Florida’s conservative western Panhandle, where he is running to fill the seat being vacated by Representative Jeff Miller.
 “With the terrorist attacks that we have seen on our country, we are under a constant threat, and it’s not going away,” Mr. Evers said on Tuesday. “And we can no longer, I feel, count on our own government to protect us.”
 But the timing of the announcement, even as funerals for the shooting victims continued, led many commenters on Mr. Evers’s campaign site and his Twitter account to express disgust.
 Mr. Evers, who has served in the State Legislature since 2001, has had an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association for 14 years, according to his campaign website. He said he himself owns an AR-15.
 Asked whether the giveaway risked offending even strong Second Amendment supporters, Mr. Evers said that when he heard about the Orlando shooting, he said a prayer for the victims, and donated money.
 “But you know, there’s not a bad time to protect yourself,” he added. “And even though my heart goes out to the victims and their family and friends in Orlando, I don’t believe in offering just political platitudes. I believe in taking action.”
 AR-15-style rifles have become a focal point of the national debate over gun control. Known for their ease of operation, they have been used to mow down dozens of people by mass shooters in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Roseburg, Ore.
 Despite being banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004, along with other so-called assault weapons, it is the best-selling style of long gun in the United States. The National Rifle Association calls it “America’s rifle.”
 Brian Burgess, a spokesman for Mr. Evers, said Tuesday that the AR-15 giveaway was devised in part as a response to what he described as President Obama’s refusal to talk openly about radical Islam.
 “When President Obama went down to Orlando, he made that event about a firearm,” Mr. Burgess said. “It’s clear to folks in our district, and it’s clear to Greg, that we can’t depend on the federal government to identify the cause and root it out.”
 Speaking two days after the mass shooting, Mr. Obama rejected criticism from Donald J. Trump and other Republicans over his refusal to use the label “radical Islam” when talking about the Islamic State group, to which the Orlando attacker had claimed allegiance.
 “There’s no magic to the phrase ‘radical Islam.’ It’s a political talking point. It’s not a strategy,” Mr. Obama said.
 Despite calls for stricter gun control after the massacre, the Senate on Monday failed to advance four separate measures aimed at curbing firearm sales. On the same day, the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to Connecticut’s ban on semiautomatic rifles, introduced after the Newtown massacre.
 Mr. Evers’s campaign said the winner of the rifle giveaway will be selected on July Fourth, and will be chosen from among people who “liked” or shared his Facebook page.

4398,"The squids are all right — as are their cephalopod cousins the cuttlefish and octopus.
 In the same waters where fish have faced serious declines, the tentacled trio is thriving, according to a study published Monday.
 “Cephalopods have increased in the world’s oceans over the last six decades,” Zoë Doubleday, a marine ecologist from the University of Adelaide in Australia, and lead author of the study, said in an email. “Our results suggest that something is going on in the marine environment on a large scale, which is advantageous to cephalopods.”
 Dr. Doubleday and her team compiled the first global-scale database of cephalopod population numbers, spanning from 1953 to 2013. It included historical catch rates for 35 cephalopod species, including the Japanese flying squid, the giant Pacific octopus and the common cuttlefish. The species inhabit marine ecosystems all over the world, from Australia and the United States to Morocco and Madagascar, among other countries.
 “When we looked at the data by cephalopod group we were like ‘Oh my God — they’re all going up,’ ” she said.
 She said it was remarkable how consistent the increases were among the three cephalopod groups, which included species that swim in the open seas and creatures that scuttle through tide pools. They published their findings in the journal Current Biology.
 According to a 2015 World Wildlife Fund report, some 1,200 marine vertebrate species, including fish like mackerels and tunas, declined by nearly half between 1970 and 2012.
 “That’s not just the loss of some fish and some turtles,” wrote John Tanzer, the director of the W.W.F. International Marine Program, in the report. “That’s the unravelling of the fabric of an ecosystem that sustains life on Earth.”
 But cephalopods, which are invertebrates, have increased across the board.
 Dr. Doubleday and her team are currently investigating why the cephalopods are doing so well while the numbers of other marine animals like fish are falling. She suspects that climate change and overfishing are two causes. Warming oceans, while detrimental to some fish, may be creating beneficial growing conditions for some cephalopods, and overfishing could potentially reduce the numbers of fish that prey on the squishy snacks, she said.
 Finding the answer, she said, “may tell us an even bigger story about how human activities are changing the ocean.”

1077,"The annual Yulin Lychee and Dog Meat Festival, which will open this week coinciding with the summer solstice, has drawn domestic and international condemnation from people concerned with animal rights. But one aspect of the festival gets little attention: Why lychees with dog meat?
 There are hints in traditional Chinese medicine, which takes a holistic view of food. Ingredients are seen not just as a sum of carbohydrates, protein, fat and vitamins. They are believed to have yin and yang properties that contribute to the body’s internal balance.
 According to traditional Chinese medicine, some foods, like lamb and onion, have warm energy. Others, like rabbit and asparagus, are said to have cool energy. Both dog meat and lychees are seen as warming.
 To the uninitiated, the logic may seem mysterious. But many Chinese adhere to these principles, and it is not uncommon to hear a friend say he or she is “shanghuole,” or has too much internal fire. In traditional Chinese medicine, excessive internal heat is tied to symptoms like cold sores and dehydration, which can be treated by eating “cooling” foods like cucumber or watermelon.
 In parts of China, dog meat is typically consumed in the winter because it is seen as warming and restorative.
 But in the southern Chinese city of Yulin, some say eating dog meat and drinking lychee liquor on the summer solstice is an old tradition. Lychees are locally grown in the subtropical clime, and the concept of “yire gongre,” or using heat to attack heat, is also prevalent.
 Critics say the festival itself may have been a marketing ploy started around 2009 to increase sales of dog meat and lychees.

5068,"BERLIN — The German comic who prompted an international incident with a satirical poem about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey will fight the ruling of a Hamburg court that banned repeating most of the text, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
 In a ruling made public late Tuesday, the superior state court in Hamburg said that the comic, Jan Böhmermann, could repeat a few selected lines but not the bulk of the poem, “which, because of its insulting content injuring his honor, Mr. Erdogan does not have to accept.”
 Christian Schertz, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Böhmermann, said the comic rejected the partial injunction imposed by the court because it tried to dissect the poem into permitted and forbidden parts and, in that way, suggested that artistic freedom was somehow divisible.
 Mr. Böhmermann will fight the ruling all the way to the federal constitutional court if need be, Mr. Schertz said in a statement and in a phone interview.
 Mr. Schertz said that the Hamburg court’s ruling failed to take into account the way in which Mr. Böhmermann had framed his poem as deliberate satire, interspersing his reading of it with several remarks noting that the verse was an example of what would be impermissible.
 Mr. Böhmermann read the poem, which contained extremely crude language, on his television show on March 31. By the next day, it had become a litmus test of artistic freedom in Germany, after the public broadcaster ZDF first pulled the show from its digital archive then restored it minus the reading of the poem.
 In what she has since conceded was a mistake, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said through her spokesman on April 4 that she found the poem offensive. Mr. Erdogan went on to sue Mr. Böhmermann for insulting him under an obscure German law that requires the government to give consent in cases of insulting a head of state.
 Ms. Merkel’s coalition government split over how to proceed, with the chancellor eventually giving the go-ahead to Mr. Erdogan but also announcing that the relevant law, which dates from 1871, would be repealed.
 The city-state of Hamburg said this month that it would try to push the repeal through the upper house of Parliament, with the intention of getting the law off the books and thus rendering action against Mr. Böhmermann moot.
 The Turkish leader has also filed a private suit against Mr. Böhmermann that would proceed through the courts under a different law governing such individual action. That suit is currently under scrutiny by state prosecutors in Mainz, which is where ZDF has its headquarters and thus where Mr. Erdogan is pursuing the private suit.
 The Mainz prosecutors said in a brief statement on Wednesday that they did not yet know whether or when their case would proceed.

8577,"In New York on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump proved they are front-runners for good reason.
 The state was always going to be friendly turf for them: Mrs. Clinton won two Senate races in New York, and Mr. Trump’s political sensibilities are acutely attuned to the state’s small and dwindling Republican minority.
 But the scale of their victories reflects more than a home-field advantage, and it exposes some important limitations in their opponents’ campaigns. Some of the key takeaways:
 Mrs. Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by crushing him in New York City and its suburbs, easily winning black and Hispanic voters and holding down his margins in friendlier upstate areas. Her political coalition simply looks more like the national Democratic base than his does. In a big state like New York that is more closely reflective of national demographics, that is a decisive advantage.
 Even in upstate cities where Mr. Sanders might have been a more natural fit, like Syracuse and Buffalo, Mrs. Clinton won or fought him to an effective tie.
 It may be that Mrs. Clinton’s position here was unassailable all along: In 2008, she handily defeated Barack Obama in New York’s Democratic primary, taking 57 percent of the vote. On Tuesday, she was on track to beat Mr. Sanders with almost the same level of support.
 Mr. Sanders managed to hold on to the slice of voters who agree most strongly with his message of economic populism. Exit polls show that he won by double digits among voters who said Wall Street mainly hurts the economy and among those who want the next president to be more liberal than Mr. Obama, and that he won by a narrower margin with those who said foreign trade destroys jobs.
 But in as urban and diverse a state as New York, that assemblage of voters goes only so far. Mr. Sanders got wiped out on issues of sharper local resonance: Mrs. Clinton made her more liberal record on gun control a major campaign theme and beat him on the issue by 22 percentage points.
 He needed a big win to reverse nearly a month of setbacks in the delegate race and to quiet stories about disorder in his campaign. And New York delivered: Mr. Trump captured the state by his largest victory margin of the campaign and left Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his closest rival in the delegate race, in a distant third place.
 If Mr. Trump’s opponents hoped for even scattered signs of voters recoiling from his candidacy, there were none to be seen. He won voters of every age, race and income level, and he prevailed with two groups — college-educated voters and women — who have often rejected him. That adds up to a considerable show of strength for a candidate who still faces a narrow path to clinching the Republican nomination, even after a sweep or near sweep of his home state’s 95 delegates.
 Mr. Cruz appeared to enter the Republican primary in New York with the wind at his back, having beaten Mr. Trump convincingly in Wisconsin and in a string of smaller contests. But he got demolished in New York, coming in third over all and failing to win a single county. He even placed behind Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio upstate, where Mr. Cruz had once hoped to generate interest among rural conservatives and peel away a few delegates.
 Mr. Cruz plainly paid a price for his derisive comments in the past about “New York values,” and those remarks may have made the state a fool’s errand for him from the start.
 But Mr. Cruz may have a deeper cultural problem: In the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic States that have voted so far, he has performed well only in Maine, where he won a surprise caucus victory. If his brand of religion-inflected Texas conservatism cannot connect with a blue-state Republican audience, next week’s primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island may be just as painful.
 It has been more than a month since Mr. Kasich won Ohio, his home state and still his only victory. But on Tuesday, he claimed a modest symbolic prize, snatching Mr. Trump’s home borough, Manhattan, from beneath the front-runner’s nose.
 Mr. Kasich, always the softest-edged candidate in the race, has positioned himself in increasingly explicit terms as the standard-bearer for Republican moderates. That is a diminishing group, but it was enough to win him the only county in the state that Mr. Trump lost, and it could help him collect delegates in the blue-state primaries on April 26.

4280,"Over the weekend an exhibition opened at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Entitled “Uniformity,” it displays 71 pieces from the museum’s collection of (surprise) uniforms, divided into four categories — military, work, school, sports — as well as a select group of the fashion looks they influenced, like Geoffrey Beene’s 1967 sequined football jersey gown and Rei Kawakubo’s 1998 military vest and pleated skirt for Comme des Garçons.
 “I was interested in the inherent dichotomy between uniforms and fashion,” said Emma McClendon, assistant curator of costume, and the organizer of the exhibition, “because while they should be antithetical to one another — the first is about conformity, the second about creativity — they are also deeply interrelated. It’s ironic.”
 But not as ironic as the fact that the show opens just as a number of recent disputes have underscored a somewhat different, and disruptive, reality. We live in a moment in which the notion of a uniform is increasingly out of fashion, at least when it comes to the implicit codes of professional and public life. Indeed, the museum may be the only place they now make sense.
 If once upon a time Melanie Griffith’s character in “Working Girl” could manipulate viewers’ assumptions about her job and background simply by swapping leather jackets and minidresses for greige suits, today it would be impossible. “We are in a very murky period,” Ms. McClendon said.
 Just before the museum’s show opened, for example, Britain was momentarily distracted from discussions over Brexit (leaving the European Union) by the news that Nicola Thorp, a temp worker, had been sent home from her receptionist job at PricewaterhouseCoopers for refusing to wear heels, as dictated by the dress code of her agency, Portico.
 She took her cause public, starting a petition for a parliamentary hearing titled “Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work.” If you get more than 100,000 signatures, Parliament will consider the petition, and as of Tuesday afternoon she had 140,712.
 Almost immediately, ITV, the British television network, conducted a poll on whether employers should be allowed to require women to wear heels; social media freaked out; and Portico announced it had changed its policy: Flats were now acceptable for women (men, of course, could always wear them).
 A few days later, sweatergate broke out in the United States when a weather forecaster on KTLA-TV in Los Angeles was handed a gray sweater to cover up a tank dress she was wearing on the air. She said it was a joke, courtesy of her co-anchor, but Twitter took offense, perceiving it as an attempt to control what women wear.
 All of this follows famous dress code brouhahas like the UBS scandal of 2010 when the Internet discovered that the Swiss bank had issued a 44-page booklet of guidelines for employee dress that included instructions on shoulder width and underwear shade.
 Then there was the “flat shoe” uproar of 2015, when two women were supposedly barred from the red carpet in Cannes for not wearing heels. (The festival director denied the report on Twitter.)
 And earlier this year, Kansas State Senator Mitch Holmes was forced to issue a public apology for having included, in his guidelines for the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee, which he chaired, a rule for those appearing before the state panel that read: “Conferees should be dressed in professional attire. For ladies, low-cut necklines and miniskirts are inappropriate.” No such specific guidelines were issued for men. Oops. This did not sit well with many.
 “I have decided to retract the conferee guidelines,” he said later in a statement, which also noted, “My failure to clearly specify that all conferees, regardless of gender, should strive to present themselves professionally is unacceptable.”
 The slippery slope may have started as a gentle incline way back in the 1970s, and become a bit steeper during the Casual Friday movement of the 1990s and the success of the Facebook I.P.O. in 2012 with its hoodie-wearing billionaires. But today, we are speeding down it at breakneck pace, partly thanks to the hot-button conversation around gender equality, and fluidity.
 “There has been a dramatic change very recently,” said Susan Scafidi, a law professor at Fordham University and founder of the Fashion Law Institute.
 She noted that last December the New York City Commission on Human Rights announced new guidelines for the municipal human rights law that expressly prohibited “enforcing dress codes, uniforms, and grooming standards that impose different requirements based on sex or gender.”
 As a result, no employer may require men to wear ties unless they also require women to wear ties, or ask that heels be worn unless both sexes have to wear them. And though this applies only to “official” dress codes, the trickle-down effect is inevitable.
 “Dress is now open to the interpretation of the individual, rather than an institution,” Professor Scafidi said.
 This has created an even greater tension in the more ambiguous areas of office dress, especially as the boundaries between home and work become ever blurrier.
 “There’s a strain of thought that says an employee represents a company, and thus dress is not about personal expression, but company expression,” Professor Scafidi said. “But there’s a counterargument that believes because we identify so much with our careers, we should be able to be ourselves at work.”
 And that has led to all sorts of complications. One person’s “appropriate” can easily be another’s “disgraceful,” and words like “professional,” when used to describe dress requirements, can seem so vague as to be almost meaningless. Kanye West wearing ripped jeans and a jeweled Balmain jacket at the Met Gala: cool or rude? Julia Roberts at the premiere of “Money Monster” at Cannes this year in bare feet: red carpet pioneer or a step too far?
 At The New York Times, Michael Golden, the vice chairman, told me: “We have customer-facing jobs and those that are principally internal. We ask employees to dress appropriately for the interactions planned for their day.” But that can have broad interpretations. In the newsroom, people show up in everything from double-breasted suits to shorts; from sneakers and Birkenstocks to platform heels.
 All of which leaves us where? Confused, mostly. And fast trying to create our own codes, or parse those of the offices around us. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is on the record as saying he wears the same gray T-shirt every day so that he can focus his energy on other decisions.
 Ms. McClendon acknowledges that she tends to wear “all black, pretty much every day, and sculptural shapes — it’s the museum uniform.” Professor Scafidi said, “My business uniform is a black jacket with a fitted, knee-length sheath, classic 100-millimeter single-sole pumps, and usually our logo pin — my equivalent of armor, arms and insignia, respectively.”
 Indeed, according to Ms. McClendon, uniforms evolved for a reason: “They fulfill a need to identify your place in the world,” for the wearer and the observer. At least when they are easy to read. And part of the idea behind the F.I.T. show, she said, was to “put visitors in the mind-set to consider uniform dressing more broadly, and how it impacts their own lives.”
 In other words, to live an examined life when it comes to your wardrobe and your workplace. Because these issues are only going to get more complicated.
 “We are moving into an era where personal expression is going to trump the desire to create a corporate identity,” Professor Scafidi said. “It’s a huge power shift.” And it has already begun.

5590,"Christopher Ahnberg cannot quite put his finger on the moment he started identifying as a feminist. But his appreciation for women who aren’t the shrinking-violet type goes way back, and for the sake of his future happiness, it should probably go way forward, too.
 “Growing up, my favorite shows always had strong female leads, like ‘Kate & Allie,’” Mr. Ahnberg said. “In my fifth-grade yearbook, I wrote down ‘Murphy Brown’ as my favorite show. Plus, I grew up with two strong older sisters. So I never saw women as anything but very strong people.”
 The effect Mr. Ahnberg’s sisters and Candice Bergen had on his views of gender roles may help to explain, at least partly, why he fell in love with Cristen Conger, who is part of a duo of “girls-next-door gender experts” who host a popular podcast.
 “I’m always trying to impress Cristen, because she knows so much about everything,” Mr. Ahnberg said. “I’m not talking feminism or current events, I’m talking history, everything. I can’t keep up with her. She makes me step up my game.”
 Mr. Ahnberg, 33, met Ms. Conger, 31, when both were students at the University of Georgia in 2004. But it wasn’t until August 2012, when Ms. Conger was in need of someone to go with her to the wedding of a friend, that they began dating.
 By then, both had moved to Atlanta and settled into careers, he as an executive at a company that installs home theaters and smart-home technology, and she as a journalist with a decidedly feminist point of view.
 Ms. Conger, who also grew up in Georgia, is a host, with Caroline Ervin, of “Stuff Mom Never Told You,” a weekly podcast that has attracted a loyal audience, mostly of young women. The show, known as Smnty to its viewers, trains a cleareyed focus on subjects like fashion, differences between the sexes, and women in the workplace and beyond. Titles of recent episodes include “Free the Nipple,” “Period Pride” and “Are Women Bigger Whiners?”
 Ms. Conger describes herself as a “liberal feminist” — one who believes that women should be free to pursue the lives they want. The recent dust-up over the somewhat tongue-in-cheek suggestion by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that damnation awaits women who fail to vote for Hillary Clinton caused Ms. Conger more frustration than anything.
 “I thought it was completely understandable within the context of history, if politically foolish,” she said. “What upset me the most was that it only spurred more narrow media coverage of feminists being pitted against feminists.”
 And despite her status as an emerging feminist voice, Ms. Conger had to concede that mustering up the courage to ask Mr. Ahnberg to be her date was a little unsettling.
 “I was nervous because I liked him,” she said. “I tried to play it off as a friend-date, like, ‘I have to go to this wedding; can you come with me?’ But I didn’t tell him I had been counting down the days, that it was really such an event for me.”
 The evening turned out to be less feminist than fairy tale.
 “We had a magical night,” said Ms. Conger, who is tall and slim and has a tendency to wave her hands to make a point. “I bought a new dress and had my hair done, and he showed up all dressed up in a suit and sunglasses, and he looked very studly, and the setting was this beautiful home in Marietta with a beautiful garden.”
 Ms. Conger knew early on that Mr. Ahnberg had a sharp, quick sense of humor. But it was only after a few dates, when she and Mr. Ahnberg were drinking Bloody Marys during brunch on an Atlanta restaurant’s rooftop patio, that she began to realize he had more to offer her than punch lines and someone to be her plus one at events like her friend’s wedding.
 “We started talking about feminism, and it was the first conversation I had ever had with a guy my age about feminism that was in-depth and engaging,” she recalled. “And he was not at all nervous about the term. I just remember sitting there thinking, ‘This is incredible.’ I had never experienced that with a guy.”
 Ms. Conger grew up in a fairly traditional home, but she credits her mother with instilling in her a can-do feminist mind-set.
 “She was usually working, but she also home-schooled my siblings and me,” Ms. Conger said. “Her philosophy was, ‘If you can read, you can do anything.’”
 Mr. Ahnberg says that feminism is a factor for him when voting and when he’s choosing which businesses to support. His feminist umbrage may be most on display when someone suggests that women cannot be funny.
 “I’m always shocked when anybody says that,” he said, and understandably so, when you consider that his partner does what, despite her protestations to the contrary, looks and sounds vaguely like a very good Russell Brand imitation.
 His older sister Jenn Fisher said he and Ms. Conger can break out into an improv comedy routine at a moment’s notice.
 “They make a comedy routine out of everything they do,” she said. “They could be slicing peppers to make fajitas and all of a sudden they’re breaking into a fajita song, trading verses.”
 Ms. Fisher, who lives in Atlanta and is a devoted Smnty listener, has her own ideas about how her little brother learned to be a feminist.
 “In our house, there was never, ‘I’m a woman so I can’t mow the lawn,’ or ‘I’m a man so I can’t cook a meal,’” she said. “Also, I started working when Chris was in high school, so he’s seen me go through things as a working woman that wouldn’t happen to men. It’s made him sympathetic.”
 During that rooftop brunch with Ms. Conger, that sort of attitude was on full display. But she was not the only one who felt the stirrings of love that day.
 By then, something had occurred to Mr. Ahnberg, who usually carries a warm, wide smile atop an athletic frame. “I realized I had been an idiot the entire time I had known her,” he said, “because we had been on-and-off friends since college, but she was everything I ever looked for in a woman. I wasn’t going to let her slip away.”
 He eventually decided to do what one of Ms. Conger’s feminist icons has famously suggested in song: Put a ring on it.
 Ms. Conger’s love of Beyoncé is no secret. She has praised the singer on the podcast, and last year, she performed a comedy routine she wrote, “The Gospel According to Yonce,” at Song Missing, an Atlanta literary variety show. In it, she apologizes in advance to Mr. Ahnberg, who may not be fully aware that she is “beysexual.” Her disciples read not Bibles but “beybles.”
 Ms. Conger has chosen to keep her own name, but both she and Ms. Ervin agree that it is also possible to find power in a woman who takes her husband’s last name, an issue that has been a hot topic among Smnty listeners since an episode titled “A Practical Wedding” aired in January.
 The wedding expert Meg Keene, who was a guest on the show, insisted that brides should keep their names. “She was passionate about it, and a lot of listeners felt betrayed that we didn’t step up and say, ‘It’s O.K. for people to make their own choices,’” Ms. Ervin said.
 For Ms. Conger, deciding which elements of a traditional wedding to keep and which to toss in the name of feminism involved careful consideration.
 “Ultimately, we’ve moved away from the wedding-industrial complex to do what honors us,” she said.
 But some rituals proved trickier to excise than others.
 Accepting an engagement ring, for example, required some soul-searching. “In its historic sense, the ring signified possession rather than partnership,” she explained. “But I also knew it meant a lot to Chris to make the gesture. And I know that does harken back to old-school gender norms, but I wasn’t going to trivialize something that was important to him.”
 Mr. Ahnberg’s proposal, made during a December 2014 trip to China, was certainly memorable, if not particularly radical.
 Ms. Conger said: “The first big excursion we went on was to the Great Wall of China, and we climbed to the highest point we could go, which is this lovely outlook. Chris snuck around the corner and handed off our camera to someone in our tour group. Then he got down on one knee and pulled the ring out. A number of tourists there with us were very happy.
 “It just summed up all this incredible love I know he has for me that I honestly never imagined having in my life. His support for me personally and professionally is a rare thing to find if you’re an ambitious woman.”
 They were married on May 7 at the Goat Farm Arts Center, a former cotton-gin factory turned creative hub in the Westside neighborhood of Atlanta. Ms. Conger and Mr. Ahnberg live together in a studio not too far from the altar.
 One hundred and fifty friends and family from as far as New Zealand and Paris found seats in a long courtyard nestled between two historic brick buildings. A classical guitarist strummed selections by Fernando Sor and Mauro Giuliani but transitioned to the Beatles’ “In My Life” as groomsmen in blue suits and bridesmaids in light blush dresses and, finally, Ms. Conger walked down the aisle. The bride’s father, Dan Conger, escorted her.
 Ms. Conger’s oldest brother, William T. Conger of Baton Rouge, La., a recently retired Army captain, officiated. He addressed Mr. Ahnberg directly. Mr. Conger reminded the groom about the educated and witty woman he was about to marry, but said he knew Mr. Ahnberg’s love was true. When the two look at each other, the captain said later, it is with complete attention and affection.

1368,"“I love that you still say y’all!” Cecile Richards said to Barbara Bush. Within minutes, both women sounded markedly more Texan than they had when they walked into the restaurant.
 But Texas twangs may be the least of what they have in common. The families of Ms. Bush, 34, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the chief executive of Global Health Corps, a nonprofit organization, and Ms. Richards, 58, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, go way back.
 At the 1988 Democratic convention, Governor Richards, who died in 2006, got off one of the best one-liners in memory when she said of former President (and candidate at the time) George Bush: “Poor George. He can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.” His son George W. evened the score in 1994 by beating her decisively in the Texas governor’s race.
 But there was no trace of animosity when the women met for lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill. They are enthusiastic supporters of each other’s work.
 Before becoming president of Planned Parenthood in 2006, the nation’s leading provider of reproductive health services and sex education for women, men and young people, Ms. Richards founded America Votes, a group that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now the House minority leader, and worked for many years as a labor organizer.
 Ms. Bush founded Global Health Corps in 2009 (along with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others) to address disparate health results among rich and poor countries. The organization provides yearlong fellowships to young professionals with diverse backgrounds by embedding them in health organizations in Africa and underserved communities in the United States. The number of fellows has grown from 22 in its inaugural year to 140 in its eighth class, which began this month, from a pool of over 5,000 applicants.
 Over black cod (for Ms. Bush) and branzino (for Ms. Richards), the pair discussed the challenges of growing up in political families; the politicization of health care, especially for women; and the coincidence of appearing in a recent collection of essays, “What I Told My Daughter: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Generation of Empowered Women,” edited by Nina Tassler.
 PHILIP GALANES: Let’s start with Nora Ephron, who said that, as a kid, she dreamt of being the president’s daughter because of all the attention she’d get, especially from boys. Did that indirect spotlight appeal to you?
 BARBARA BUSH: I really didn’t notice it. I was so young. When I was 8, I asked a friend when her grandfather’s inauguration was. I had just been to my grandfather’s, and I assumed everybody had one.
 PG: How about when your father ran for president?
 BB: We were 18 then. At 18, you’re focused on yourself and where you’ll go to college. Our parents wanted that for us.
 CECILE RICHARDS: I was at a very different time in my life. I was 30 when I moved back to Texas to help with Mom’s campaign. I had a 4-year-old daughter and was pregnant with twins at her inauguration.
 BB: You have twins? I’m a twin.
 CR: Twins are the best.
 PG: Did you like campaigning for your mother, or was it an obligation?
 CR: Oh, there was never any question about it. It’s different, running as a woman. And at that point, my mother wasn’t married. We were her support system. But it’s a mixed bag, seeing your parent run for office. There’s a little bit of glamour, but a lot of pain and suffering, watching them go through tough times.
 BB: I never read the media about my dad. I already had an opinion about him, millions of opinions. I didn’t need another person telling me what to think. And when it comes to attacks, people are attacking a caricature. They don’t actually know the person. I have the luxury of knowing my parents deeply.
 CR: A lot of people think of Ann Richards as larger than life. She always said: “Take me, warts and all.” But I saw the vulnerabilities that the public didn’t. One of her favorite things was going to the movies and sitting in the dark. No one could bother her there.
 PG: You also can’t criticize your parents the way we civilians can. The first time I was really aware of Barbara was when you made that P.S.A. for gay marriage. There was a firestorm about your falling out with your father.
 BB: I didn’t realize how much attention that would get. Whoopi Goldberg had done one. And Julianne Moore. They had about 70 views. I didn’t think mine was going to get many more. But, of course, it did. Because the narrative was that I was breaking with my father. But I had talked to my dad about doing it, and he was very supportive. What surprised me were all the people who said: “How brave! Betraying your family like that.” But my parents raised us to use our voices for issues we care about, and I feel strongly about marriage equality. The only brave thing is that I’m shy. That was the win: I used my voice.
 PG: It was your media debut. Meanwhile, everyone alive must know about Cecile’s marathon testimony before Congress last year over the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. Five hours! Lots of coffee or tranquilizers — or both?
 CR: They don’t let you do anything. You just sit there, at the pleasure of Congress, while they go in and out, taking breaks and talking in the hallways. I had no idea that it was going to be live-streamed on television, or that so many people would watch. I still have people come up to me on the subway and say they watched all five hours.
 PG: I couldn’t believe how rude the congressmen were. In a weird way, did they do you and Planned Parenthood a favor?
 CR: I think millions of people were exposed to the hyper-partisanship of health care, and the aggressive attitudes toward women, the disrespect. It happened to be me, but it could have been any woman. There was a real lack of empathy for what women go through to access health care.
 PG: Did you walk out of the room thinking, “I just knocked it out of the park”?
 CR: Oh, no. It was more like: I just survived an endurance test. Later, I read a text from one of my twins, Daniel, who wrote: “Mom, I’m so proud of you. You’re doing a great job. And I think raising me really prepared you for this hearing today.”
 BB: That’s so sweet.
 PG: It also brings us to your great commonality: women’s and global health. With your connections, I bet you could do anything you want. What led you to health care? The last I knew, Barbara was doing an internship at Proenza Schouler.
 BB: I still love them and would work for them still.
 PG: I remember an interview with your mother, Laura Bush, who sounded slightly apologetic that you were taking so long to land on a career. And you were only 25.
 CR: So, we share that, too: mothers who had high expectations for us. It’s a lot.
 BB: I still don’t know what my end goal is going to be.
 CR: Can I say how impressive Barbara is? It’s one thing to work at a 100-year-old organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it’s another to say: “I see a problem, and I’m going to start an organization to fix it.”
 BB: Since I was born, in 1981, we’ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year. Yet the number of deaths hasn’t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken.
 CR: All my life, I’ve been lucky to work in social justice, starting as a labor organizer working with low-wage working women. They’re the same ones we see at Planned Parenthood now: women trying to raise their kids, many of them single moms, working two jobs. And if you don’t have access to health care, women will put their health after everyone else’s. It’s like dinner was in Texas: Women took the chicken legs after everyone else had eaten. Women will go without cancer screenings or family planning, which causes unintended pregnancies. Barbara knows this from global health: If women are healthy, their families are healthy, their communities are healthy. It’s one of the most powerful ways to make social change.
 BB: Thanks to my parents, I got lots of exposure. I traveled with them when they launched Pepfar, an amazing program that saves the lives of people with H.I.V. around the world. At that time, if you were H.I.V. positive in the United States, it was just another chronic illness. But in a developing country, it was a death sentence. I met people who were mourning the deaths of their children and sisters, because they didn’t have access to drugs that exist. That blew my mind. We have the tools to solve these problems. We just need to use them more effectively.
 CR: It’s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it’s not enough unless there’s public policy that supports getting women access to care.
 PG: I can’t imagine anyone in America disagreeing with the idea that we should all have health care. So, why is this conversation so poisonous?
 CR: There’s a total disconnect between political rhetoric and where the American people are. They believe folks should have access to health care and family planning. They believe young people should have sex education. No parent wants their child to get an infection, or get pregnant before they’re ready. We’re at a 30-year low for unintended pregnancy in America. In any other moment, folks would go: “Wow! Let’s do more of that. It’s good for women and saves money.” But the political environment is tough right now.
 BB: It’s crazy, and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue, because it’s not a polarizing space. As a human, I hope everyone is healthy. And what happens in other places matters here. We saw that with Ebola. Everyone started paying attention when it seemed like it might impact us. But diseases don’t respect international borders.
 PG: Do you see big roles for storytelling and empathy?
 CR: So much shame has been placed on women, for having sex or using birth control or choosing to end a pregnancy. When women tell their stories, it makes a big difference. We learned that from the L.G.B.T. community, in terms of knowing people. Women come up to me all the time and thank me for telling my story, and sometimes they tell me theirs. But I was with three women in Pennsylvania, where they were trying to pass an outrageous, restrictive bill on abortions. These women desperately wanted their pregnancies, but learned at 20 weeks about severe fetal abnormalities. And here they were at a press conference, sharing their anguish in front of clicking cameras. I had two thoughts: What bravery. Then, why should they have to bare their souls? I see empathy every day, but I’m sorry that women still have to share their most personal stories.
 PG: The much-loathed millennials play big roles in both your organizations.
 BB: We think millennials are great. So many young people want to work on social change. They want to do good. Global Health started because this great talent pipeline was not moving into health care. It’s hard to know how you fit in if you’re not a doctor or nurse. If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we’ll have an army of people working to solve health problems.
 CR: Ten years ago, when I came to Planned Parenthood, I met these young kids who were called “peer educators.” They provided sex education in schools and talked to their principals about access to health care. They were in every town. I thought, “What you really are is leaders.” And the great thing about bringing in thousands of young people to an organization is they begin to change it. One of the things I’m proud of at Planned Parenthood is the number of health centers providing trans care, which was largely driven by young activists.
 BB: I didn’t know what was in front of me when we were starting Global Health Corps. We didn’t even know if anyone would apply. We could never have predicted that a few years in, we’d have gotten to work with 600 amazing young people, 97 percent of whom stay in global health or social justice issues related to it. Our challenge is to keep growing as responsibly as we can. But we see a huge demand.
 CR: My biggest hope is that we can take partisanship out of this arena. Not to get too political, but we have Republican patients and staff members and board members. The need for health care doesn’t come with a party label. Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman who has health insurance gets birth control at no cost. That’s 55 million women. We don’t have to invent a new kind of birth control. We just have to close the lid between needing it and delivering it. And I’m optimistic that we’re on the cusp of making that happen.
 BB: You’ve got to be an optimist.
 PG: Let’s end with Nina Tassler’s book, “What I Told My Daughter.” Cecile wrote an essay, and Barbara is the subject of her mom’s essay. So, what would you tell young women on the road to empowerment?
 CR: My mom used to say she saw too many young women passing up opportunities because they were afraid of failing. Her message to me was: “This is the only life you get. Take every chance and run with it — even if it doesn’t work out.”
 BB: When I was thinking about starting Global Health, but afraid I wasn’t ready, my mom said: “You’re in another job, but always talking about Global Health. Are you going to be happy leaving this on your to-do list forever?” It’s the same with young fellows I speak with. They’re worried about taking the “right” next step at the “right” time. But there’s never a right time. Who knows where life is going to take us?
 CR: Exactly. Just do it. What’s the worst that could happen?

8316,"LONDON — Atmosphere is where it’s at on the London stage these days, which is another way of saying that it’s difficult to imagine Lorraine Hansberry’s play “Les Blancs” divorced from the spine-tingling production now at the Olivier auditorium at the National Theater.
 Unfinished at the time of its author’s death from cancer in 1965 at age 34, “Les Blancs” remains mightily ambitious in its attempt to refract colonialism, revolution and misrule through life in and around a fragile-looking mission hospital in an unnamed African country.
 But well before a single word has been spoken, the South African director Yael Farber conjures up a sequence that transports the audience directly into the otherness of the piece. To one side of the stage, a trio of singers set a compellingly eerie mood, while a sinuous figure billed only as The Woman (Sheila Atim) threads her way through the action — a shape-shifting emblem, perhaps, of Africa itself.
 As the white inhabitants of this outpost enter through the auditorium to get into position for the opening scene, the tableau speaks volumes about the tenuous rapport between cultures, or between the outsiders and the indigenous people of a community that, we eventually realize, is imploding from within. The countdown to conflagration has begun.
 Ms. Farber made her London name two summers ago with a (very long) Old Vic production of “The Crucible,” but “Les Blancs” represents the kind of summary achievement one can only imagine happening at a playhouse like the National.
 The building’s entire resources — from the dramaturgical department through to Adam Cork’s ravishing soundscape and a stage crew there to ensure that Soutra Gilmour’s set revolves — work in concert to remind us that Hansberry was not just a one-play wonder immortalized for having written “A Raisin in the Sun.”
 The writing itself in “Les Blancs” is compelling, moment by moment, but it becomes clear just how thesis-mongering the play might seem in lesser hands. There is an American photographer on hand (the English actor Elliot Cowan) to act as our guide to this alternately brave and brutal new world.
 “I really do care about the place,” he insists rather clunkily midway through, and when others urge him later on to “write the truth,” it sounds a bit like Hansberry’s memo to herself to do justice to a continent worlds apart from her own upbringing in Chicago.
 The play is on more fertile ground in its depiction of how the mission dwellers and the Africans coexist — at least up until a cataclysmic ending that places Ms. Atim tellingly at center stage.
 Siân Phillips, the veteran British actress who turns 83 next month, has a surpassingly moving moment near the end in which she recalls how her first glimpse of Africa at age 28 prompted her to make this foreign land the place where she would spend her life.
 Among the younger generation, the ever-lovely Anna Madeley turns the role of a seemingly saintly expatriate surgeon alive to “the terror” in her midst into something quietly complex.
 Notably less humane, though every bit as vivid, is the English major whom Clive Francis presents as a scarily compelling psychopath, his every disclaimer (“I’m not a racist”) followed by an action to suggest the opposite.
 And in the play’s defining role of the itinerant Tshembe, who has returned home following his father’s death to greet what he says are “new times,” Danny Sapani deftly navigates this rhetoric-heavy play to evoke the difficulties of straddling competing impulses toward quietude and peace on the one hand and arms-taking and action on the other.
 Equal measures Hamlet and Odysseus, Tshembe stands at the anxious heart of a beautiful and haunting production in which a rarely seen slice of the American repertoire crosses the decades to speak to our globe’s ever-expanding tribalism.
 Across town at the Royal Court Theater, the director Vicky Featherstone has achieved an unusual double with two simultaneous plays at that address — and why not, since she is the Court’s artistic director?
 Her main stage entry, “X,” is a puzzle play from the fast-rising young writer Alistair McDowall set — wait for it — on a space station on Pluto, the not-quite-planet that figures infrequently on stage or screen. (“The Martian” this is not.)
 Within the gray confines of Merle Hensel’s angled set, a British crew face the limbo into which they have landed with increasing frustration and internecine sniping, not least from the team leader Gilda, whom Jessica Raine plays with an initially relentless bark that threatens to grate.
 Stick with it, and you may be as surprised as the characters surely are by the jagged shifts of a fractured plot that rewrites itself as it goes along, so much so that the second act demands a rethinking of virtually every detail of the first, including the specifics of Gilda’s circumstances.
 The title itself acquires multiple meanings, whether as an affectionate shorthand for kisses, a mathematical symbol or simply a signifier of the unknowable.
 Ms. Featherstone navigates the play’s alien — make that “Alien,” given the implicit nods in the direction of Ridley Scott’s film — terrain with impressive ease. What is more, in an age when many a new play ties itself into a neat bow at the end, “X” has the opposite and galvanic effect of leaving spectators to debate what on earth (or Pluto) they have just seen.
 In many ways the less said the better about Ms. Featherstone’s concurrent entry in the Court’s studio-sized upstairs theater, the blistering “Cyprus Avenue” from the Belfast-born writer David Ireland, a co-production with Dublin’s Abbey Theater, where it premiered in February.
 As genuinely shocking a play as I’ve come across in many a year, “Cyprus Avenue” takes its title from a middle-class Belfast street that finds room for the fearsome bigotry of the central character of Eric (Stephen Rea), an ordinary-seeming man whose actions by play’s end are extraordinarily gasp-inducing.
 Don’t worry if you’re not up on the language of Fenians and Loyalists that connects this play to the “troubles” in which Mr. Ireland’s take-no-prisoners writing is steeped, though the action takes place in the present.
 It is clear within minutes that Eric is seriously mentally adrift, as the playwright folds bitterly dark humor into the gatheringly forbidding mix: an exchange between Eric and a leather-jacketed paramilitary by the name of Slim (the priceless Chris Corrigan) surpasses even the Court alumnus Martin McDonagh in its reckless comic bravura.
 There is nothing remotely funny, though, about the concluding passages of a play unafraid — as Mr. McDonagh has done — to posit terrorism itself as a form of psychosis. And though the astonishing Mr. Rea, in one of the defining performances of his career, is required to laugh softly as the lights fade, the abiding chill cast by the play even now is hard to shake.

591,"Nakuru is a lakeside city in Kenya’s Rift Valley, a destination for safari tourists and part of the Great Rift, the tectonic seam that gave birth to humanity and will one day rend Africa in two. Kenyans often refer to the valley simply as the Rift, a nod not just to the millions of years of volcanic tumult that produced its magnificent landscape but also to the centuries of tribal warfare it has seen.
 In December 2007, Eric, a day laborer now in his late 20s, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was living on the outskirts of Naku­ru with his wife and young daughters, in one of the shanty neighborhoods tourists don’t see. That month, Kenya held an election. It was to be only the second truly open contest in the country’s history, but typically for Kenyan politics, it was cleaving along tribal lines. The incumbent, a conservative bureaucrat named Mwai Kibaki, was a member of the Kikuyu, Kenya’s predominant tribe. His challenger, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s foremost liberal provocateur, was a Luo, who historically were the Kikuyu’s main rival for power. Odinga had assembled a broad ethnic coalition, capitalizing on resentment of the Kikuyu.
 Nakuru was majority Kikuyu but had a sizable population of other tribes. As the election approached, Eric, a Luo, became anxious listening to his Kikuyu friends, who insisted Kibaki be returned to office at any cost. The Kikuyu had liberated Kenya from colonialism, they insisted, and the country was rightfully theirs. Other tribespeople were demanding the president be forced from power. “We were just agreeing with what they were saying,” Eric told me, when I spoke with him recently. “We were afraid that if we did not, it would come to fighting.”
 After Kibaki was declared the winner, death squads led by members of the Kalenjin tribe loyal to Odinga’s coalition set to massacring Kiku­yu throughout the Rift Valley. Then men with a Kikuyu criminal gang, called Mungiki, began retaliating. Soon word came that the gang had arrived in Nakuru. “They came to revenge,” Eric heard. By day they set up roadblocks, where they stopped civilians and murdered and raped them in plain view; by night they assailed homes.
 Eric took his family to a displaced-persons camp next to the police station, but there was no food, so they left. He was asleep one night in early January when he heard voices outside his home. He got under his bed. A group of men entered and told him to come out.
 “I’m Kikuyu,” Eric said instinctively.
 They demanded to see his identification. He said he’d left it at work. They spoke in the Kikuyu language to him, to see if Eric could answer. He knew only a few words. “Asha,” he kept saying: No.
 One of the men found Eric’s ID. His family name is clearly Luo. The intruders began beating him. One asked if he was circumcised. (Circumcision is a Kikuyu tradition and point of pride.) Eric cried that he was. They tore his pants off.
 “You lie!” they yelled.
 “I pleaded with them,” Eric told me. “ ‘Leave my life, please. In God’s name.’ They could not hear that. They went ahead with their plan.”
 A man forcibly circumcised him with a machete. Then they hacked at Eric’s arm and head until he lost consciousness.
 The violence spread across the country. Though Kenya is among the most developed places in Africa, for two months, death and torture were meted out with machete, club and knife. People were dismembered, gang-raped, burned alive in homes and churches. Many men were, like Eric, forcibly circumcised. Kenya was brought to the brink of civil war. The official number of dead was between 1,100 and 1,200 by the end of February 2008, when international envoys brokered a truce, though Kenyan investigators say the real figure is probably much higher. Roughly half a million people were displaced; many never returned home. It was the worst crisis Kenya had faced since its fight for independence a half-century earlier.
 In 2010, the International Criminal Court, the Hague-based tribunal created in 1998 to try the worst atrocities on earth — war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide — announced plans to charge six Kenyans for orchestrating the postelection violence. The most important suspect was Uhuru Kenyatta; the son of Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, he was considered by many Kikuyu to be their natural leader. The court’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, sought to charge Kenyatta with five counts of crimes against humanity, for inciting murder, rape, forcible transfer of people, persecution and “other inhumane acts.”
 During his tenure at the I.C.C., which ended in 2012, Moreno-Ocampo examined atrocities in a dozen countries and brought cases in seven. But the Kenyatta case has come to define the court and, many would say, has permanently discredited it. Moreno-Ocampo accused Kenyatta of suborning the Mungiki to kill innocent Kenyans, but he also believed Kenyatta’s crimes emerged from a tradition of impunity in Africa, one that would continue unless he stepped in. He saw prosecuting Kenyatta as a way to change not just a country but an entire continent and, in some small measure, the world. “These were not just crimes against innocent Kenyans,” Moreno-Ocam­po said at the time. “They were crimes against humanity as a whole.”
 Kenyatta, now Kenya’s president, not only denied the charges against him but also called the I.C.C. “the toy of declining imperial powers.” It’s a view other African leaders increasingly claim to share. Today Kenyatta is leading a push at the African Union to abandon the court. In April, an African Union committee considered a plan to demand that heads of state be immune from I.C.C. prosecution, among other potentially crippling measures. At a summit conference next month in Rwanda, it will continue a discussion about collectively withdrawing from the court. With all but one of its open cases related to crimes in Africa, this would almost certainly relegate the I.C.C. to permanent irrelevance.
 In October, I met Moreno-Ocampo at the InterContinental Hotel in Vienna to discuss the Kenyatta case. I found him in the lobby bar, slouched low in an ornate settee, in jeans and a black long-sleeve collarless shirt. Except for the MacBook Air propped in his lap, he looked like a detective in a 1960s French movie: mussed gray hair, bristling eyebrows, rakish trimmed beard. When I phoned to arrange the meeting, we (mostly he) talked for more than an hour. He was ingratiating, telling me, “You’re doing a very important story.” But in Vienna he was at first circumspect — he’d received word from colleagues that I was asking questions. He didn’t stand but extended a reluctant hand from the settee, nodded and smiled knowingly, as though we’d already met.
 He soon relaxed, and we talked for most of the rest of the day. As our conversation grew more candid, he sank further into the settee, eventually almost lying down, his feet on a cushion. At one point Moreno-Ocampo, who is 64, took hold of his laptop and summoned YouTube. He pulled up a clip from a Kenyan comedy program called “The XYZ Show,” which lampoons figures in the news with puppets.
 “Have you ever seen this?” he asked me. Moreno-Ocampo was a running character, and the real man adored the show. He turned up the volume, unconcerned about the other patrons looking over in annoyance, and laughed loudly. “Brilliant!” he said. “Great.”
 Moreno-Ocampo explained that argument was his birthright. His youth in Argentina was punctuated by coups that divided his family. He went to law school “because my country was a mess,” he said. In 1976, a military junta, claiming Argentina was in the grip of a Communist insurgency, took control. The junta, which killed, kidnapped or tortured more than 20,000 Argentines, counted among its members one of his uncles. After it was ousted, its leaders were put on trial. In 1984, Moreno-Ocampo, then in his early 30s, was made deputy prosecutor. (He indicted his uncle.) His performance in court established his reputation, though some Argentines were put off. Miriam Lewin, a journalist who was tortured and later testified, told me that while Moreno-Ocampo appreciated the momentousness of the trials, his idealism was undone by his arrogance. “Many survivors didn’t want to come forward and talk because they were afraid for their lives,” she said. “He didn’t seem to understand that.”
 The junta leaders received stiff sentences, but in 1990 they were pardoned by a new president. “I was furious,” Moreno-Ocampo told me. “The trials were not just about the crimes. It was a way to change the country.”
 Notions of human rights that transcend borders originate in antiquity, but the first international war-crimes tribunal, historians believe, did not take place until the 15th century. The first large and truly successful one was not until almost 500 years later, at Nuremberg. After the Cold War, human rights became a centerpiece of Western foreign policy, at least nominally, and in the 1990s, the United Nations Security Council set up criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Lebanon followed. In June 1998, diplomats from 160 countries gathered in Rome to discuss a permanent international criminal court.
 African diplomats were particularly intent. On top of the genocide in Rwanda, the 1990s had brought civil wars or campaigns of systematized violence to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Algeria, Burundi, Niger, Ivory Coast and Chad. Atrocities were committed by officials who also controlled their countries’ justice systems. For its Western proponents, an international criminal court was largely a matter of conscience. For Africans, it was a way to fight impunity. “We wanted ways of enforcing good government in Africa,” Betty Murungi, a lawyer in the Kenyan delegation in Rome, told me.
 When the court was formed, it was, one observer wrote, “an international epiphany.” It was also, it seemed, a great moment for Africa. Senegal was the first country to ratify the court’s founding treaty, the Rome Statute. Archbishop Desmond Tutu called the I.C.C. “Africa’s court.” Today, 34 of the court’s 124 member states are African, the largest contingent after Europe’s.
 In 2003, after the I.C.C. received the 60 ratifications it needed to begin work, Moreno-Ocam­po was appointed chief prosecutor and moved into the court’s offices in a white metallic tower in The Hague. Member states had the ability to refer atrocities within their borders if they felt they could not handle investigations, as well as to refer them in other member states. The Security Council could refer investigations anywhere. And Moreno-Ocampo had the power to open investigations without any referral if he could show an atrocity had been committed and wasn’t being redressed.
 In one of his first speeches in The Hague, Moreno-Ocampo announced he was monitoring the violence in Congo and invited its government to make a referral. The Congolese president did so several months later. Then the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, approached Moreno-Ocampo. Joseph Kony, whose Lord’s Resistance Army had torn apart northern Uganda, had proved uncatchable. Perhaps the I.C.C. might force him out of the bush? Moreno-Ocampo began investigations in both countries. He was pleased: His first two inquiries addressed major atrocities in Africa, the continent that most concerned him and human rights advocates, and each had begun by invitation.
 For Uhuru Kenyatta, rule was a birthright. His father, Jomo Kenyatta, was imprisoned by the British colonial government during the fight for independence. After Jomo was freed and elected president of an independent Kenya in 1964, however, his revolutionary impulses didn’t persist. He stocked the government and businesses with family members and fellow Kikuyu and “operated with little concern for the niceties of law,” the historian Charles Hornsby writes, “traveling with his inner circle from residence to residence like a medieval monarch.” Jomo’s portrait still adorns every denomination of paper money in Kenya, and his family is believed to be the country’s largest landholder.
 After graduating from Amherst College in Massachusetts, Uhuru showed little interest in politics before 1997, when, in his mid-30s, he stood for Parliament and lost. In 2002, he ran for the presidency, on the strength of his name, and lost again. The man who beat him, Mwai Kibaki, had been a close friend of Jomo Kenyatta’s. Kibaki took Uhuru under his wing, later putting him in the cabinet and, it was clear, grooming him as his successor.
 To many Kenyans, Uhuru — whose personal fortune, most of it presumably inherited, has been estimated at a half-billion dollars — embodies their country’s inequity. More than a quarter of Kenyans live on less than two dollars a day, according to World Bank estimates. So taken for granted are corruption and impunity that the country’s official and criminal classes are often indistinguishable.
 Kenyatta’s rise coincided with the rise of Mungiki, the group Moreno-Ocampo would later accuse him of conspiring with in the postelection violence. Started as a tribal revivalist movement, Mungiki grew into a militaristic political fraternity and then into a criminal gang. Around the time Mungiki fought to take over the lucrative private bus lines that are the main form of transport in Kenya, in the early 2000s, the gang staged a massacre in northern Nairobi that left severed heads scattered in the streets.
 By then, Mungiki was being described as a “state within a state,” with up to two million members, according to reports. They swore an oath of loyalty to the Kikuyu tribe and the Mungiki leader, a charismatic, ruthless man known as Maina Njenga. According to the I.C.C., new recruits “were told they would be killed if they violated the oath or left the organization.” When clashes broke out between Kikuyu and other tribes, Njenga dispatched his men to fight.
 He also persuaded politicians to take the Mungiki oath. Paul Muite, a member of Parliament at the time and now a lawyer who represents Njenga and other members of Mungiki, which is still active, told me that almost every Kikuyu politician of consequence he knew during that era took the oath. For Njenga, it was “a way of collecting” power, Muite says. According to Muite and a former lieutenant of Njenga’s with whom I spoke, one of the politicians who took the oath, before becoming president, was Kibaki.
 Some Mungiki members, including Njenga, supported Kenyatta’s 2002 presidential campaign. Kenyatta denounced the group and would later tell Moreno-Ocampo in court that “I have always publicly condemned and stated that I have no association whatsoever with Mungiki.” Njenga’s former lieutenant, however, described to me a series of meetings he attended with Kenyatta and Njenga in 2002, saying that Kenyatta was friendly with Mungiki. But, he added, Kenyatta didn’t like or trust Njenga.
 In the 2007 election, Kenyatta did not run, instead supporting Kibaki in his race against Raila Odinga. By the close of Election Day, two days after Christmas, the vote was too close to call. The count was delayed. The tally center in Nairobi was mysteriously broken into. Then on Dec. 30, the government suddenly announced Kibaki had won. He was hurriedly sworn in, and a media blackout was imposed. Odinga instructed his followers to protest. By New Year’s Day, Kikuyu were being slaughtered. Mungiki began striking back in January.
 The government did little to stop the postelection violence, but afterward, it set up a commission of inquiry. Known as the Waki Commission, it issued a 529-page report in October 2008. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, an autonomous government agency, published a comparably exhaustive report. Each was damning. Officials in Odinga’s party had planned violence months in advance, while envoys of President Kibaki met with Mungiki to plan retaliatory attacks. Security agents and the police had conspired with the gang. “There were no good guys,” a Waki commissioner, Pascal Kambale, told me. “There were only bad guys.”
 Moreno-Ocampo, who monitored the violence as it was happening, traveled to Nairobi to speak with Kibaki. He encouraged Kibaki to refer Kenya to the I.C.C., as Congo and Uganda had made referrals. Government capacity wasn’t the problem, Moreno-Ocampo knew. Kenya was capable of trying the suspects. The problem was as it had been in Argentina: The government was the criminal. And not only the government. The National Commission on Human Rights report listed more than 200 suspected inciters and funders of the violence, including presidential cabinet members, legislators, businessmen, shopkeepers, farmers. In a moment of collective insanity, Kenyan society had turned on itself.
 Still, Moreno-Ocampo continued to press Kenyan officials to begin prosecutions. In 2009, the Kenyan Parliament voted against a tribunal — unsurprisingly, as the Parliament itself was full of suspects — and Moreno-Ocampo requested that the I.C.C. judges allow him to open an investigation. They did. It was the first time he invoked his power to seek charges on his own authority, without a referral.
 The challenges were considerable, he knew. It was one thing to investigate militias at the invitation of a government, but quite another to investigate a government. Yet Moreno-Ocampo felt this was what the I.C.C. had been created for — to fight impunity. “This is a different kind of case,” he told The Times in 2010. “This isn’t about militias. It’s about politicians and political parties. It’s about investigating leadership.”
 Polls showed a majority of Kenyans approved of the I.C.C.’s intervention. An editorial in The Nation, Kenya’s main daily newspaper, said, “No one has ever come as close as [Moreno-Ocampo] to slaying the dragon of impunity in Kenya.” On the buses of Nairobi, where operators compete for fares by adorning their vehicles with icons — Jesus Christ, Tupac Shakur, Arsenal forwards — Moreno-Ocampo’s face appeared.
 The I.C.C.’s preliminary examination in Kenya was based largely on the work of the Kenyan commissions. Each had heard testimony that Kenyatta was at meetings with Mungiki. The Waki report didn’t name Kenyatta, but the National Commission on Human Rights report did, saying that he reportedly “attended meetings to plan for retaliatory violence by the Kikuyus” and “contributed funds.” Kenyatta was considered by many Kikuyu, including many Mungiki, to be their leader, and was understood to be the richest man in the country. If anyone had the motivation and funds to back an ethnic war, Moreno-Ocampo’s investigators reasoned, it was Kenyatta.
 Moreno-Ocampo had by now built important cases in Uganda, Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan. “The world’s prosecutor,” as he was dubbed, seemed to be everywhere: magazine spreads, cable news, Davos. His critics complained that he thrust himself into the limelight, and they had a point — he allowed four different feature documentary crews access to The Hague — but even they couldn’t deny that he put the court on the map.
 By the time the preliminary examination in Kenya began, however, the other cases had stalled. Only one trial, that of the Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga, was underway. The court’s lack of political and prosecutorial powers were partly to blame. The United States, China and Russia had refused to join it. George W. Bush openly tried to cripple it by, among other things, demanding immunity for Americans. And Moreno-Ocampo had none of the prosecutorial resources — subpoenas, surveillance, policing — available to his domestic counterparts. Alex Whiting, a onetime federal prosecutor in Boston who became Moreno-Ocampo’s prosecutions coordinator, told me the Kenyatta case “was like trying to prosecute an organized-crime case without the tools the Department of Justice uses to prosecute organized crime” — though, for this reason, Moreno-Ocampo’s temperament was an asset. “You have to have a big ego, because you don’t have much else.”
 But Moreno-Ocampo himself may have been the greatest obstacle to the court’s success, members of his staff told me. They didn’t question his devotion — he often worked seven days a week, closely managing every case — but increasingly they questioned his judgment, which seemed always caught between that ego and his idealism. He inspired fierce admiration and dislike, sometimes in the same people. One attorney, who resigned because he couldn’t stand Moreno-Ocampo, nevertheless lauded the prosecutor’s commitment. Another, whom Moreno-Ocampo reduced to tears in meetings, defended him to me adamantly. When the journal World Affairs published a critical profile of Moreno-Ocampo, one former staff member attacked another in the online comments section.
 In Vienna, I heard Moreno-Ocampo express remorse only twice. Once was when I asked about the atmosphere in The Hague. “It was a mess,” he acknowledged. “I fought with all of my guys, because I was involved in everything. That’s the problem: All of us were totally emotionally involved. If not, you’re not there.”
 A larger problem was his vision of the court’s mission. He believed in the pre-emptive power of prosecution — “the shadow of the court,” as he liked to call it. In his inaugural address in The Hague, Moreno-Ocampo said the court’s success would be measured not by how many cases it tried but by how few. One investigator I spoke with said Moreno-Ocampo seemed to see the I.C.C. not as a forensic body so much as a “naming and shaming” organization, like Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International. And while it was true that the court’s small budget limited the size of his investigations, he was, some say, already more interested in prominence than evidence. A former court attorney told me: “He would see the leader of a state and say: ‘There must be evidence out there. Go get it for me.’ ”
 The investigation in Congo began calamitously. Bernard Lavigne, formerly a French domestic prosecutor, became Moreno-Ocampo’s first lead investigator in Congo. “We accumulated a lot of information about one militia,” Lavigne told me. “Then suddenly, because of a political decision by Luis or his political committee, we were obliged to change our planning and our investigative work and concentrate on a new target. It was completely crazy. ... We put in danger a lot of people.” The case Moreno-Ocampo brought against Lubanga, for recruiting child soldiers, “barely scratched the surface of the conflict,” Paul Seils, the first director of Moreno-Ocampo’s preliminary-examination unit, says. Moreno-Ocam­po removed the lead attorney weeks before the trial commenced and clashed with the presiding justice, who accused him of trying to undermine the judiciary and pervert the Rome Statute.
 In conversation, Moreno-Ocampo has a habit of ignoring criticism. It’s unclear if this is confidence or evasion. When I asked him about the censure, he described that judge as “brilliant” and “great.”
 After the United Nations Security Council referred the atrocities in Darfur to the I.C.C. in 2005, the court charged President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan with crimes against humanity, war crimes and, later, genocide. The judges issued an arrest warrant. There is little question Bashir is guilty of the first two charges. He could be guilty of genocide too, but the court’s investigation was not the best proof of it. An attorney involved told me the prosecutor’s office did little independent work: Investigators never went to Darfur. When I brought this up, Moreno-Ocampo said: “Sometimes some of the lawyers are not going to understand the case. I’m sorry for them.”
 Bashir was not popular in Africa, but he was the first head of state the court charged. This made other leaders, especially those accused of atrocities, nervous. It also vexed African Union diplomats who were trying to broker a peace in Darfur. (Muammar el-Qaddafi, whom the court would later charge with war crimes in Libya, was at the time the African Union’s chairman.) In 2008, the African Union passed a resolution that said charging African heads of state was an affront to the “sovereignty and integrity of the continent.” Bashir called the I.C.C. a “colonial court.” Self-serving though his position was, it caught on. Complaints about the I.C.C.’s “Africa bias” piled up.
 Unbowed, Moreno-Ocampo pushed on in Kenya. In December 2010, he announced the suspects he wanted to charge. For the first wave of postelection violence, he named the chairman of Odinga’s party and Joshua Arap Sang, a radio host who had broadcast anti-Kikuyu hate speech. A member of Parliament, William Ruto, was accused of being the ringleader. For the second wave, committed by Mungiki and the police, he named Kibaki’s cabinet secretary, Francis Muthaura; the commissioner of police, Gen. Mohammed Hussein Ali; and Kenyatta.
 Before announcing the suspects, Moreno-Ocam­po met with Kenyans including investigators and lawyers at the Serena Hotel in Nairobi. The lawyers approved of his desire to combat impunity and prevent political violence during the next election in Kenya. But they warned him that Kenya wasn’t Sudan or Congo. Its politicians were just as ruthless but more sophisticated. The suspects would try to kill the cases and discredit the I.C.C. So would President Kibaki’s government. Kenyatta, elevated to deputy prime minister after the postelection violence, was his protégé. “They’re going to fight back very, very hard,” James Gondi, a Kenyan lawyer who had interned at the I.C.C., told Moreno-Ocampo. But the prosecutor seemed unconcerned. He pointed out that he’d put away generals in Argentina.
 Later, some questioned whether Kenyatta was as culpable as the case against him claimed. George Kegoro, the Waki Commission secretary, told me that when Kenyatta was questioned by the commission, he “saw himself as a peace­maker.” Pascal Kambale, the Waki commissioner, said that “irrespective of Kenyatta’s involvement, Mungiki was going to do what they did.”
 In the I.C.C. system at the time, the prosecutor’s office collected enough evidence for the court to hold pretrial hearings, in which the judges would decide whether there were sufficient grounds to confirm the charges. If they did, the cases proceeded. This gave defendants ample time to destroy evidence and interfere with witnesses, a recurring problem.
 By the time Moreno-Ocampo’s team got moving in Kenya, more than two years had elapsed since the postelection violence. Their investigation, which would go on for over four years, was far more rigorous than those in Congo or Sudan. They interviewed hundreds of victims and suspected perpetrators. But many witnesses who had opened up to the Kenyan commissions were no longer willing to speak.
 Faced with a dwindling pool of evidence, Moreno-Ocampo’s team approached General Ali’s attorney with a possible offer: If Ali testified against Kenyatta and Muthaura, the charges against him might be dismissed. The Kenyan commissions had gathered strong evidence against Ali, but circumstances had changed. The attorney general had forbidden the police to speak to the I.C.C. According to Kenyan investigators with whom I spoke, other police officers who were involved in the violence had been killed. Ali turned down the offer. The judges didn’t confirm the charges against him. The prosecutor’s office later withdrew the cases against Muthaura and Odinga’s party chairman.
 There was one group willing to help the court: Mungiki. Many gang members were gone — “killed or forcibly disappeared in an apparent cleanup operation,” the prosecution claimed — but some were still alive and willing to testify. Especially crucial were three confidential Mungiki “linkage” witnesses. One claimed he saw Kenyatta at meetings where attacks were planned; another, that he was told of these meetings, though he wasn’t present; and a third, that he met with Kenyatta beforehand to discuss violence.
 The case hinged on these men. But some people in the prosecutor’s office worried about their reliability. Kenyatta’s attorney claimed in court that the first two witnesses tried to extort him in exchange for information that could aid the defense, and when he refused, threatened him. He showed little evidence of the claim, but neither did the prosecution dispute it. (“It strikes me as entirely plausible,” Benjamin Gumpert, an I.C.C. lawyer who worked on the Kenyatta case, told me.) Kenyans who knew the third witness, meanwhile, not only doubted his account but also questioned whether he was in Mungiki. Maina Njenga’s former lieutenant says the witness was never in the gang. There were arguments in The Hague over whether to use him. The former court attorney told me it appeared the man would say anything to get into the court’s protection program. But the case against Kenyatta was too thin to sacrifice him.
 Moreno-Ocampo admitted to me that the evidence against Kenyatta was not as strong as he would have liked. But all he had to do for the moment was get through the pretrial hearings. After that, more evidence could be found. And he had a card up his sleeve: Maina Njenga.
 Moreno-Ocampo’s team had considered charging the Mungiki leader. Instead, they had turned him. When Njenga was questioned by Kenyan investigators, he pleaded ignorance. But to the I.C.C. investigators, he came clean. He detailed the structure of his organization and its role in the violence. Njenga claimed to his lawyer, Paul Muite, that he had personally administered the Mungiki oath of loyalty to Kenyatta, though whether Njenga told this to I.C.C. investigators is unclear. Njenga was “very forthright,” Muite told me, and he later agreed to testify in The Hague.
 Moreno-Ocampo cross-examined Kenyatta on Sept. 29, 2011. Kenyatta had traveled to The Hague with supporters, who filled the public gallery of the windowless blond-wood courtroom. Kenyatta was not required to attend the hearings, nor to testify, and some Kenyans had encouraged him to skip them in order to spite Moreno-Ocam­po. But he had a good reason to go: He intended to run for president, and he would use the trial as a campaign set piece, styling himself as a patriotic victim who had taken the fall for his sinister political opponents and been attacked by arrogant foreigners.
 At first Moreno-Ocampo had been popular in Kenya. Once the charges were announced, however, tribal ranks closed. The defendants stoked fears of ethnic persecution. Privately, proxies did worse. “People would come in knocking on the door at night and say, ‘We know that your son is with the I.C.C.,’ ” Phakiso Mochochoko, who ran witness protection for the I.C.C., told me. “ ‘We’re going to burn down your house tomorrow.’ ” Witnesses and court personnel were exposed. The court’s Kenyan outreach coordinator received death threats. One victim’s attorney in the Kenyatta case left the country for his safety. Mochochoko says, “We have never had a case with this level of threats, directed not only at witnesses but anyone perceived to be witnesses, or perceived to be cooperating.”
 But some of the indignation was genuine. There was a gulf of understanding between the court and Kenya, one Moreno-Ocampo, whose political guile was undercut by his political tone-deafness, never quite grasped. The court’s very mission involves trying atrocities that stem from cultural conflicts whose nuances its lawyers and judges, from their remove in The Hague, can’t hope to fully appreciate. “I’m not at all sure that international courts really are set up to understand the realities of the conditions they’re investigating,” Paul Seils, of Moreno-Ocampo’s preliminary-examination unit, told me.
 Many Kenyans didn’t see why so few should stand trial for a social upheaval caused by so many. They thought the defendants were guilty and were proud of them for it. Kikuyu believed Kenyatta had protected them in a tribal war. Non-Kikuyu felt the same of William Ruto. And the Kenyatta case in particular had unsettling reverberations. Kenyatta’s father had been tried by the British for leading Mau Mau freedom fighters, most of them Kikuyu, whose rebellion in the 1950s precipitated Kenya’s independence. (Mungiki traces its origin to these guerrillas.) The court had no sound evidence against the elder Kenyatta, who denied any connection to Mau Mau. He was convicted anyway. Now his son was facing eerily similar accusations. For many Kenyans, the trial felt like a return to colonialism. Indeed, after the I.C.C. defendants were named, they came to be known in Kenya as the Ocampo Six, a reference to the Kapenguria Six, the group of suspects that included Jomo Kenyatta.
 Uhuru Kenyatta knew he could portray his trial as a heroic struggle — but only if he upstaged Moreno-Ocampo in the cross-examination, which was being broadcast live on Kenyan television.
 For his own part, Moreno-Ocampo had debated whether to question Kenyatta himself. He had never interrogated a witness in the Hague courtroom. He decided to go ahead only days before the hearing. “I could not delegate,” he told me: The case was too important. His preparations were bafflingly scant. When I asked how long he took to learn about Mungiki, the crux of the case, Moreno-Ocampo replied breezily: “Me? Two hours.” His staff was worried but knew protest was pointless.
 As Moreno-Ocampo rose to begin the questioning, Kenyatta’s face stiffened. The prosecutor hadn’t been speaking long, however, when his team, next to him in the prosecution box, sensed something was wrong. Their boss was uncharacteristically awkward and hesitant. His queries were aimless. Kenyatta fended him off at every turn. He blamed Raila Odinga for the postelection violence and wedged in right­eous speeches. “Ultimately, violence does not help any particular situation, whether you are aggrieved or not,” he said.
 Some members of Moreno-Ocampo’s team grew nervous. One member put his hands to his face; another shifted in her chair. This is just embarrassing, one thought. At one point Moreno-Ocampo, seeming desperate for the defendant’s help, asked: “So you have no information about the violence in detail?”
 Fifteen minutes in, Kenyatta, cottoning to Moreno-Ocampo’s lack of preparation, relaxed in the stand. After Moreno-Ocampo asked a particularly ill phrased question, a wry smirk overtook the defendant’s face. Looking at the judges, he said, coolly, “I think the prosecutor does not understand our system.”
 Moreno-Ocampo gained his footing halfway through the 45-minute session, when he asked about the cash payments Kenyatta had reportedly made to Mungiki. Kenyatta scoffed, but then overstepped, saying: “I wish I did have that amount of money.”
 Moreno-Ocampo knew this was preposterous: Kenyatta is among the wealthiest men in Africa. He had an opening. “Can you describe to the court the amount of your patrimony?” Moreno-Ocampo asked.
 Kenyatta chuckled and looked at the judges. “I did not understand what he has just asked,” he said.
 Moreno-Ocampo, flustered, repeated the question: “Can you describe to the court the entirety of your patrimony? How much money you have?” The presiding judge frowned and told Moreno-Ocampo to move on.
 When I asked Moreno-Ocampo about the cross-examination in Vienna, he responded tersely. “I took my decision, and I know why I did it,” he said. “I don’t think it was a big difference.” He commended Kenyatta’s performance, calling him “courageous” and “great.”
 He never confronted Kenyatta with Maina Njenga’s statements. When I asked why, Moreno-Ocampo told me it would have been irresponsible. “I didn’t think I should expose Maina Njenga,” he said. “I cannot protect him.” There had already been multiple attempts on Njenga’s life. Many followers had been killed, as had his wife. It was clear that powerful people wanted him dead.
 Though the charges against Kenyatta were confirmed, he had shown himself to be the defender of Kenya, its rightful president. Older Kenyans were reminded of the commanding performance his father gave in a courtroom a half-century earlier. He officially declared his candidacy after returning from The Hague. A campaign spokesman said Kenyatta was “anointed by God to lead the people.” A Nation editorial said he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the postelection violence.
 The I.C.C. chief prosecutor’s term is nine years, and in 2012 Moreno-Ocampo left the court. “For me, it was an honor and a pleasure to serve the Kenyan people,” he said in his final news conference. The Kenya cases were important to him personally, “to do justice for the past” and “to be sure that the next elections are peaceful.”
 The presidential election in March 2013 pitted Kenyatta against Raila Odinga. It was peaceful. Kenyatta won, with William Ruto as his running mate. It was assumed that they detested each other — Ruto, a member of the Kalenjin tribe, was formerly a close ally of Odinga’s and faced almost identical charges at The Hague as Kenyatta, only for ordering the deaths of Kenyatta’s tribesmen. But in running together, they had an unbeatable, if hugely cynical, message: hatred for the I.C.C. and, by extension, the West. “Kenyatta didn’t have some grand electoral strategy,” a campaign adviser to Kenyatta’s party, Peter Kagwanja, told me. “Today, if you want to win an election in Africa, you just have to have the West bash you.”
 Kenyatta invited President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda to speak at his inauguration. Nine years earlier, Museveni asked the I.C.C. to prosecute the Lord’s Resistance Army, and the prosecutor’s office had built its best cases against Joseph Kony and his deputies. (One of them, Dominic Ongwen, is currently awaiting trial in The Hague.) But in his speech, Museveni, who was marking his 28th year in power, congratulated Kenyan voters for rejecting “the blackmail” of the I.C.C., which the West used “to install leaders of their choice in Africa and eliminate the ones they do not like.”
 Kenyatta and Ruto’s alliance surprised Moreno-Ocampo. He knew they were smart, but “I never suspected they were so smart to create the ticket.” Once they won, the Kenya cases disintegrated. It had emerged that in 2009, the third key witness against Kenyatta, who claimed to have discussed violence with him personally, had been tracked down by two Kenyan men in California. They recorded a video in which he went back on his testimony. After the election, the prosecutor’s office dropped him. Several months later, the first two witnesses withdrew from the case. According to the prosecution, all three men were bribed. Paul Muite, who represents the first two witnesses, told me he believes this is true. There are now witness-interference cases pending at The Hague against three Kenyans. Muite added that even if they were paid off, the witnesses can never return to Kenya. Once the government “knows you’re a witness, you have literally signed your death warrant,” he said.
 When countries join the I.C.C., they agree to submit their highest officials, even their presidents, to prosecution if the occasion arises. The Kenyan government showed early on it had no intention of meeting this obligation. At the United Nations, its diplomats lobbied, unsuccessfully, to have the cases suspended. The Kenyan Parliament voted to abdicate the court. Requests for information went unanswered. The attorney general refused to turn over phone, land and asset records of Kenyatta’s. One man who was investigated (though not charged) by the I.C.C. for trying to expose witnesses, Dennis Itumbi, now works in Kenyatta’s office. (Kenyatta’s office did not respond to requests for comment for this article.)
 In December 2014, the I.C.C. withdrew the charges against Kenyatta. A news release blamed unreliable witnesses and the Kenyan government’s obstruction. In response, Kenyatta tweeted: “As they say, one case down, two more to go.” In April of this year, the cases against Ruto and Sang were vacated.
 The Kenyatta case could technically be reinitiated, but it’s difficult to see that happening. The prosecution tried to recruit new Mungiki witnesses but couldn’t. People who had tried to help the court, like George Kegoro, the Waki Commission secretary, no longer trust it. Kegoro told me Moreno-Ocampo never seemed to appreciate the chances he and other Kenyans took. “They put a lot of people at risk,” he said. “Living as I do here, the best thing is to keep off someone like Ocampo.”
 Moreno-Ocampo now divides his time between Buenos Aires and New York, where he practices at the firm Getnick & Getnick. After a decade in the spotlight, he has disappeared from view. Today it is hard to find anyone working in international justice to speak well of him. “He rushed into something in the belief it would give him publicity and credibility,” Cherif Bassiouni, an international lawyer and one of the drafters of the Rome Statute, told me of the Kenyatta case. “Instead he created a now almost impossible situation which has discredited the court.”
 Even at The Hague, I found few people willing to defend Moreno-Ocampo. “There’s perhaps a risk,” the trial attorney Benjamin Gumpert said, “when you are concentrating first and foremost on the message a case is going to send, that more technical considerations, like are we actually going to convict this person, may feel more subsidiary.”
 Moreno-Ocampo says he did everything he could to convict Kenyatta, but he didn’t dispute Gumpert’s characterization. The message a case sends, the shadow of the court — that was the goal. The problem with courts, Moreno-Ocampo told me, is they “believe the trials are the most important things. No. The most important thing is the prevention of crime.” He had set out to prevent future political violence in Kenya, and in this sense at least, the Kenyatta case was a success. “The suspect became president. But there was no violence in the elections.”
 Kenyatta doesn’t look at it that way. In a speech to the African Union after his inauguration, he said, “The West sees no irony in preaching justice to a people they have disenfranchised, exploited, taxed and brutalized.” His efforts to banish the I.C.C. from Africa are backed by a growing list of African leaders. Among the most vocal, aside from Museveni, are the presidents of Zimbabwe and Rwanda, and, of course, Omar al-Bashir. That all of these men have been accused of atrocities of their own is not coincidental. But even President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, which was once the court’s main advocate in Africa, has joined the chorus.
 What Kenyatta did not mention in his speech is that four of the court’s 18 judges are African, as is almost a fifth of its staff. Moreno-Ocampo’s successor as chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is Gambian and has been trying to mend the court’s relationship with the African Union. In The Hague, I asked her if she was troubled that almost all her cases concern Africa.
 “No,” Bensouda replied. “I am an African, and a proud African for that matter. I love my continent dearly. But I cannot sit here and tell you that I’m not concerned about the trouble that my continent is in for the past I don’t know how many years. I’m very troubled by that.”
 In Vienna, I told Moreno-Ocampo about Eric, the man attacked by Mungiki in his home. The day after the attack, Eric woke up in a Nakuru hospital to find that half of his left arm had been amputated. His head was slashed. His wife explained that, while he was being tortured, she and their daughters hid in a cupboard in the bedroom. Police officers rushed to their home and took the family to the hospital, where they lived for weeks, because it was too dangerous to leave.
 They traveled across the country to the home of Eric’s mother, who still supports them. Eric can’t find work. Hoping for some compensation, he joined the case against Kenyatta. I asked him what he thought when he learned the case had been withdrawn. “I have not seen any justice,” he said.
 The second time I saw Moreno-Ocampo express remorse was when I told him this.
 “It’s awful,” he said, his face dropping. “I remember a lady in [Kenya] who, the only hope for her was us. And now I imagine how bad she felt. That I feel badly about.”
 The former lieutenant of Njenga’s, like many Kenyans I’ve spoken with, says he regrets the violence but believes it was necessary. The Kikuyu, his tribe, faced a massacre, he is convinced.
 The last time we met, I asked if he thought Kenyatta was guilty of the I.C.C. charges. He recounted a meeting he attended in January 2008, in the midst of the postelection violence, where Kenyatta was the chief guest and Mungiki were present. In the meeting, Kenyatta was careful never to mention violence explicitly nor the gang by name. But he collected cash donations. I asked the former lieutenant if it was possible Kenyatta did not understand violence was being planned.
 “No,” he said, “it is not possible.”
 I asked again.
 “No,” he repeated. “With capital letters.”
",
6276,"HOUSTON — He was known as the “maestro,” the man whose every word was dissected by oil traders and moved markets. For two decades, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, was the architect of Saudi and OPEC cartel policies, including the one that has now sent the price of oil into a deep collapse.
 But Mr. Naimi was unceremoniously ousted over the weekend, replaced as part of the new order in Saudi Arabia led by King Salman, aimed at a sweeping, if long-term, modernization of the country’s economy.
 Mr. Naimi’s successor, Khalid al-Falih, is a big supporter of the king’s agenda and now will be charged with the complicated task of sharply cutting the state’s persistent dependence on oil.
 While the symbolism of the moves was clear, energy experts say they expect no quick or easy change in policy. Sharp departures in economic policy have been the exception rather than the rule for the conservative kingdom over many decades. And Mr. Falih wasted little time in trying to calm markets amid fears that already volatile oil prices could quickly become even more volatile.
 “Saudi Arabia will maintain its stable petroleum policies,” he said in a statement issued on Sunday. “We remain committed to maintaining our role in international energy markets and strengthening our position as the world’s most reliable supplier of energy.”
 That means Saudi Arabia will probably continue to pump as much oil as possible, helping to assure that gasoline prices for American consumers will stay low through the summer and that energy prices will be kept down for at least the rest of the year.
 Inside Saudi Arabia, there is plenty of skepticism that the change at the highest level of the government will be sufficient to drive reforms promised by King Salman and engineered by his powerful son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to reduce the dependence of the unsteady statist economy on the future of oil, which now appears increasingly unreliable.
 Mr. Naimi’s ouster was part of a shake-up announced on Saturday aimed at restructuring the Saudi government to diversify the economy and improve services for Saudi citizens.
 At the core of the plan released last month, in which Mr. Falih will now play a major role, is the transformation of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco into an industrial conglomerate.
 Prince Mohammed has said that shares of the company will be sold publicly for the first time in its history and that the money will be put into a sovereign wealth fund that will be invested at home and abroad to supplement government revenues.
 Saudi Aramco has long been the most effective institution in Saudi Arabia, but it has been intensely private about its finances and how it estimates the kingdom’s oil reserves.
 Opening up the company would subject it to new scrutiny that could change its culture in unpredictable ways, analysts say. And routing its worth into investments merely shifts the focus from one type of revenue — from oil — to others that are unpredictable and do nothing to increase the productivity of Saudi workers.
 Mr. Falih is a Texas A&M graduate in mechanical engineering who worked his way up the ranks of Saudi Aramco, eventually becoming its chief executive. He is viewed by international oil executives and analysts as an agent of change but still a technocrat who has long been tied to the old Saudi Aramco culture.
 Oil executives and analysts described Mr. Falih as one of the most sophisticated and cosmopolitan officials in the world of oil, already widely recognized as a leader among the ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who together control a third of the world’s oil production.
 They expect him to encourage a gradual rise in global oil prices while he moves the kingdom away from wasteful domestic energy consumption, a change that will allow the Saudis to increase oil exports in the years to come. He will take over a newly reorganized ministry that will now hold sway over all facets of energy and industry, not just oil.
 “Khalid is a very effective executive with a very sophisticated understanding of policy,” said Daniel Yergin, an energy historian and vice chairman of the global consulting firm IHS.
 “It’s a natural transition,” Mr. Yergin said. “Now, there is a big new agenda ahead for Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Aramco is central to it. You need somebody who can implement and execute.”
 Mr. Falih’s first concern will be managing OPEC, which is deeply divided between members like Venezuela and Algeria that want to cut production to raise prices and the wealthier Persian Gulf kingdoms that are content to let the price remain low for a while.
 Low prices are forcing higher-cost producers, like the companies drilling in the American shale fields, Canadian oil sands and Brazilian and West African deepwater fields, to give up investing in expensive projects.
 While King Salman will make the final decisions, Mr. Falih could use his influence to affect current policy. But his influence can go only so far.
 The oil market has bounced around in recent days. Prices have been pulled down by persistent reports of record inventories in the United States and elsewhere, and pushed up by reports of rapid production declines in the United States, China, Mexico and now Canada, as fires swirl near the oil sands fields in Alberta.
 The wild cards in the market are numerous, including how much political instability in Libya, Iraq, Venezuela and Nigeria will curb their oil production.
 With the oil price collapse that Mr. Naimi helped engineer approaching its third year, oil production in the United States alone has fallen from a high of nearly 9.7 million barrels a day to 8.8 million barrels.
 Scores of American companies have gone bankrupt, and cuts in exploration and production budgets have thrown roughly 120,000 employees out of work.
 Mr. Naimi tried to bridge the gaps among OPEC members, Russia and other international producers at a summit in Qatar last month, with a proposal to freeze production at current levels.
 Those efforts were stymied by Prince Mohammed, who refused to go along with a freeze unless Iran went along. But Iran, which has sworn to produce several hundred thousand more barrels of oil a day, now that it has been relieved of sanctions over its nuclear program, would not cooperate.
 Mr. Falih can be expected to stay close to Prince Mohammed’s line. Analysts say this is not likely to change anytime soon, as long as tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran remain high, particularly over conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
 But Middle East oil executives said a gradual shift in Saudi and OPEC policies might happen now that oil production in many countries was falling and prices had firmed somewhat in recent weeks.
 They said Mr. Falih might conclude that prolonged low prices would cause a collapse in exploration investments that could set off a sudden, uncontrollable price increase. Such turbulence would not only jeopardize the world economy, but also spur a renewed drilling frenzy in the United States and other countries, which would only lead to another price collapse.
 “Khalid al-Falih is likely to recognize the dangers of having a very low oil price for a long period,” said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates. “He may shift the policy to ensure a soft landing on price recovery.”

766,"Donald J. Trump announced on Thursday that he would convert $50 million that he had lent to his presidential campaign into a contribution, fulfilling a pledge he made in mid-May.
 The decision appears intended to halt speculation that Mr. Trump might seek to recoup his substantial out-of-pocket costs with donations from supporters, clearing the way for him to adopt a more conventional fund-raising approach for the general election. In partnership with the Republican National Committee, Mr. Trump has been seeking to tap into traditional sources of money, including large and small donors, to bolster his own contributions to his campaign.
 The decision was announced by Mr. Trump’s finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, in an interview with Reuters.
 The campaign said in a statement: “After self-funding his primary election, Mr. Trump and the campaign have assembled an exceptional fund-raising operation, which in recent days has been overwhelmed with contributions for the Republican Party.”
 But Mr. Trump’s decision was largely foreordained. Under federal rules, Mr. Trump’s campaign had only until August, a few weeks after the Republican convention, to repay the loan.

 Hard to believe, but it’s been 10 years since the first episode of Inside The New York Times Book Review. Started in 2006 by Dwight Garner, the senior editor at the Book Review then and now a book critic for The Times, the show was hosted by Sam Tanenhaus, an editor of the Book Review, from its inception until 2013. In the very first episode, Tanenhaus spoke with the novelist Gary Shteyngart. Guests later in that first year would include Maurice Sendak, John Waters, Jennifer Egan, Vendela Vida, Dave Eggers and Lemony Snicket. And over the ensuding decade, the show would welcome John Updike, Toni Morrison, Donna Tartt and Keith Richards, among many others.
 On this special episode of the podcast, Pamela Paul, the current editor of the Book Review and host of the podcast, talks to Tanenhaus, Garner and Shteyngart about the history of the show, favorite (and least favorite) guests and more.

1536,"BASEL, Switzerland — The most talked about installation at the 47th edition of the Art Basel fair, which opened this week in Switzerland and runs through Sunday, could hardly have been a more extreme metaphor for the current trepidation of the art market.
 The Belgian artist Hans Op de Beeck’s gray plaster interior, “The Collector’s House,” is a private museum completely covered in what appears to be volcanic ash. It seemed to sum up the market’s uncertainty in the face of political and financial tensions.
 “The economy is so volatile, the world so precarious at the moment,” said Arianne Levene, an art consultant in London. “People want to play it safe and buy a solid investment.”
 Mr. de Beeck’s walk-in installation was one among a record 88 artworks in the fair’s huge Unlimited project space, which is adjacent to the fair’s main Galleries section. Unlimited’s buyer base, for reasons of scale, tends to be restricted to private and public museums.
 “It’s a unique opportunity to present large-scale installations that can’t be presented anywhere else,” said Adrian Turner, a partner at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York, one of three dealerships collaborating to present the piece. “Sharing with other galleries helps with the burden of cost and gets more collectors in front of it.” “The Collector’s House” was priced at 750,000 euros, about $820,000, and as of Thursday was still available.
 Some eyebrows were raised by the gargantuan scale of some of these Unlimited projects, given the more selective mood in today’s art market. Despite year-on-year totals that were down by as much as 64 percent at last month’s Impressionist, modern and contemporary auctions in New York, works like Frank Stella’s 50-foot-wide “Damascus Gate (Stretch Variation I),” from 1970, sold to an Asian collection on Thursday for $14 million. James Rosenquist’s 46-foot-wide “Four New Clear Women” from 1982 was available for $4 million.
 A preponderance of such historical pieces was also noted at Unlimited. “They’re here because of the conservative nature of today’s market,” said Michael Short, an art adviser in Berlin “If you’re going to spend $5 million you want to spend it on something that will get you $5 million back.”
 Some significant sales were made after Unlimited’s Monday night preview. Paul McCarthy’s 1994 sculpture “Tomato Head (Green),” presented by Hauser & Wirth and priced at $4.75 million, was bought by an American private collection, and the New York dealer Skarstedt found a home for Mike Kelley’s 50-part work on paper, “Reconstructed History,” from 1989, at $1.5 million.
 The Tuesday preview of the main Galleries section, which features 286 exhibitors from 33 countries, was a far more telling indicator of how the world’s leading art dealers are faring in today’s uncertain times. As collectors filed through the rain into the two-floor Messe Basel, it soon became clear that the “primary” trade in new works by contemporary artists and “secondary” re-sales by dealers and auction houses — usually at significantly higher prices — are two distinct markets. Even though visitors were moving with less urgency than they had been in recent years and the lunchtime lines looked shorter, new “primary market’’ pieces by bankable names were selling steadily.
 A 2016 “Degenerate Art” abstract by the Romanian-born auction favorite Adrian Ghenie, priced at $460,000, was among the numerous early sales by the Paris dealer Thaddaeus Ropac, helped by the knowledge that a 2014 canvas by Mr. Ghenie sold for $4.5 million at Sotheby’s in February. The Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo gallery Blum & Poe sold the typically stylized Yoshitomo Nara figure painting, “Mia,” also dated 2016, for $700,000.
 Chantal Crousel of Paris sold a new Wade Guyton inkjet-on-linen painting of the metal frame of a Marcel Breuer chair the artist owns. This was bought for $600,000 by a French collector. It was one of five new large-scale works offered by different dealers at the fair. In 2014, at the height of the last art market boom, five such Guyton works sold for $350,000 each.
 Back then, many collectors and advisers would rush upstairs to the cutting-edge galleries on Art Basel’s first floor to snap up the latest abstracts by artists in their 20s and 30s. But the speculative mania for young abstraction has cooled.
 Instead, collectors this year were focusing on work like Rodney Graham’s painstakingly devised 2016 lightbox photograph, “Artist in Artists’ Bar, 1950s,” showing the 67-year-old Vancouver artist sitting pensively in an imaginary bar surrounded by 20th-century modernist abstracts (which he himself had painted). Two of the four examples of this editioned work were sold by New York’s 303 Gallery, priced at $275,000 each, with the remaining two on reserve.
 “Basel was more conservative this year both in terms of what people brought and what people were buying,” said Ms. Levene, the London art consultant. “Clients are nervous about buying works by younger artists if they’re not sure where their careers are going.”
 Collectors would, however, love to acquire new works by Njideka Akunyili Crosby, but at the moment museums, which dealers regard as the key to building an artist’s long-term reputation, are the only buyers.
 Ms. Crosby, 33, is a Los Angeles artist of Nigerian birth who makes large-scale figurative portraits using a range of media on paper. In March, the Whitney Museum of American Art bought a diptych portrait shown by the London dealer Victoria Miro at the Armory Show in New York. Here at Basel, the dealer sold the serene nine-foot-wide portrait of a woman in an interior, “Super Blue Omo,” for an undisclosed five-figure sum to another, as yet undisclosed American institution. Victoria Miro’s co-director, Glenn Scott Wright, said the dealership has a waiting list of 18 museums for examples of Ms. Crosby’s work.
 The continuing desirability of new art bought directly from galleries was emphasized on Wednesday in an Art Market Confidence survey published by the London analysts ArtTactic. Based on responses from 122 experts, the survey’s confidence indicator for dealers in the primary market stood at 64, up 32 percent over the past six months, while that for the auction market stood at 42, a decline of 7 percent over the same period.”The market has changed,” said Andrew Fabricant, a partner at the Richard Gray Gallery of Chicago and New York, which was exhibiting at Basel.. “The auction houses have been marketing B-quality works as masterpieces and people are waking up.” But Mr. Fabricant added that the secondary market for works re-offered by dealers has also become more price-sensitive.
 A 2014 Rudolf Stingel gold brocade-pattern “wallpaper” painting on his booth priced at $2 million attracted at least 50 inquiries at the Tuesday preview, but no sale by Thursday. Another gold example, but dating from 2004 and almost twice the size, was bought at auction in 2014 for $1.4 million. “Prices will continue to change,” Mr. Fabricant said.
 But high quality secondary market works by blue-chip artists were selling at Art Basel, if perceived to be at a fair price. The New York and London dealer Dominique Levy, for example, sold a totally market-fresh white kaolin on pleated canvas “Achrome” by Piero Manzoni from 1958-1959 for just under $7 million. An example of the same size and date sold at auction in February for $8.1 million, according to the Artnet database of salesroom results.
 A few booths away on the ground floor, the London dealership Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert sold the 1981 Sean Scully canvas “Enough,” one of the first of the [British] American-based Irish artist’s trademark striped abstracts, to a New York collector for about $ 1million.“There’s a lot going on in the world at the moment, but wealthy collectors have enough money to ride out this situation,” said the gallery’s director, James Holland-Hibbert, who deals almost exclusively in secondary market works. “But they are price-sensitive at the moment. If a good work doesn’t sell you know you’ve just priced it too high.”

4190,"BENTON HARBOR, Mich. — Fresh off a landmark victory, Bernhard Langer will try to enter a league of his own at the Senior P.G.A. Championship.
 Langer is coming off the 100th victory of his career — at a major, no less — having won the Regions Tradition in Alabama. It was his sixth major championship as a senior, and he became the second player, after Jack Nicklaus, to have won four different majors on the senior tour, now known as the PGA Tour Champions.
 Nicklaus was the first to win the Senior Grand Slam — it took him all of two years to win the four after he turned 50 in 1990 — but he had largely retired by the time the Senior British Open was added to the major rotation. Nicklaus played that event as a major only once, in its first year, 2003.
 Langer is going for an unprecedented sweep of all five senior majors as the Senior P.G.A. begins Thursday at Harbor Shores.
 “It’s huge in a sense that nobody’s ever done it before,” Langer said. “We have had many, many great players and illustrious careers, and they haven’t.”
 He added: “Nobody’s ever done it. So it’s a challenge. And I like challenges. I like to set goals, and I wasn’t even aware of that until last week. So this is a new goal of mine, and it’s fun. It’s fun to look forward to doing something that is unusual.”
 Langer, 58, contended the last two times the Senior P.G.A. was at the Nicklaus-designed Harbor Shores, in 2012 and 2014, and he figures to be one of the favorites based on his play this year. He has already won twice and leads the money list.
 Winning back-to-back major titles is difficult enough. Langer is faced with winning back-to-back majors in successive weeks. Under the PGA Tour Champions schedule, three major tournaments are held in a four-week stretch, with the Senior Players Championship two weeks from now.
 Then again, Langer has done this before.
 Six years ago, he won the Senior British Open at Carnoustie and then traveled across eight time zones and won the United States Senior Open at Sahalee outside Seattle.
 “That’s hard to do because your body is worn out, and we’re wearing out faster in our 50s than the 20- or 30-year-olds do,” Langer said. “And they don’t have back-to-back majors. You learn how to manage your time and your lifestyle and what you need to do to prepare, and some prepare more, some prepare less. I feel I’m well prepared. I do what I need to do, and hopefully I’m not going to be tired come Saturday or Sunday.”
 John Daly will play his second of what could be seven majors this year on both tours — he is exempt into the P.G.A. Championship and the British Open as a past champion. Daly has failed to seriously contend in his two PGA Tour Champions events since turning 50.
 He has tied for 15th and 17th in his two tournaments, although Daly said he was still shaking off rust from not playing much before he turned 50.
 “I’m not expecting a lot this week,” he said. “I would love to play great this week, but as long as I keep making a lot of birdies, for me that’s the key. Because I know I’m going to make mistakes; I know I’m going to make doubles right now. It’s just trying to not make so many of them until I got my game where I want it.”
 Colin Montgomerie is the two-time defending champion.
 For years, Montgomerie was viewed as being one of the best Wednesday interviews in golf, and this Wednesday was no exception. Going for his third straight title in the seniors’ oldest championship, Montgomerie was asked if he had ever won a tournament three times in a row.
 “Just the P.G.A.,” he replied.
 Montgomerie never won the P.G.A. Championship, or any regular major, so the question was posed again.
 “Just the P.G.A. at Wentworth,” he said, referring to the European Tour’s flagship event. “That was all. It wasn’t such a big deal, really. Beat Ernie Els again in 1998. And then I won in ’99 and 2000. So yes, I’ve won one tournament three times in a row, the P.G.A. And I’m looking at this P.G.A. here. So let’s hope there’s fate involved.”

3418,"SPRECKELS, Calif. — Bernie Sanders signaled Wednesday that he would continue his presidential campaign beyond the California primary next week, saying he had the money to keep running until the Democratic National Convention next month.
 During a news conference while campaigning in California, the Vermont senator said he already had plans to host events in Washington next week and to lobby superdelegates to withdraw their support from Hillary Clinton and back him instead. He added that he felt confident he can win California’s primary on Tuesday and that Mrs. Clinton was campaigning in the state because of polls showing the two locked in a tight race there. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Wednesday shows the race in a statistical tie.
 “We have absolutely the financial resources that we need to run a very, very strong campaign here in California and in the other states and in D.C. and Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands and throughout the rest of the campaign,” Mr. Sanders said.
 He chided Mrs. Clinton for deciding to campaign in California, where she is counting on minority voters to propel her to victory.
 “I wonder why Secretary Clinton and her husband, Bill, are back in California?” Mr. Sanders said, with a touch of sarcasm. “I thought we had lost and it was all over. But I guess Secretary Clinton is maybe looking at some polling that would suggest otherwise.”
 While Mrs. Clinton is just 71 delegates shy of the 2,383 needed to clinch the nomination, Mr. Sanders said he was “feeling pretty good” about his campaign and hoped superdelegates would realize that he was the best candidate to beat Donald J. Trump in the general election. He also said he hoped the next week would bring victories that could help him make his case at the party’s convention in Philadelphia.
 “If we win California, and if we win South Dakota, and North Dakota and Montana and New Mexico and New Jersey, and the following week do well in Washington, D.C.,” he said, “I think we will be marching into the Democratic convention with an enormous amount of momentum.”
 Mr. Sanders also said he hoped that a round of coming victories would help him and his allies encourage the party to include a nationwide ban on fracking in the Democratic platform.
 “I would hope that the Democratic Party makes it clear that it has the guts to stand up to the fossil fuel industry,” he said.

737,"WASHINGTON — C-Span knew it had a problem.
 Democrats had unexpectedly sat down in the middle of the House of Representatives chamber to demand a vote on gun control legislation, and with the body officially in recess, C-Span, the cable network known for “gavel to gavel” coverage of Congress, had no means to cover it.
 Then it found an unlikely source: the social media feeds of House members who had turned to Periscope, a live video-streaming app, and Facebook Live.
 “As soon as we knew it was available, we went for it,” Terry Murphy, C-Span’s vice president for programming, said on Thursday after a short night’s sleep. “We didn’t know when we got into it that we would be doing it for 24 hours. There just wasn’t much time to debate it.”
 So began what was arguably the most memorable 24-hour period the network has seen in years, one that Mr. Murphy estimated had probably set a record for continuous broadcast of a social media feed and that others suggested amounted to something of a declaration of independence from congressional landlords, who control the TV cameras inside the Senate and House chambers.
 But it was perhaps even more momentous for Periscope, which debuted just over a year ago after being acquired by Twitter.
 As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Twitter messages that one or both of the live video streams broadcast by Representatives Scott Peters and Eric Swalwell of California embedded had already been viewed more than a million times, according to the company.
 “We always told ourselves that if we were successful, we were building a tool to give a voice to the voiceless,” Kayvon Beykpour, co-founder and chief executive of Periscope, said in an interview. “It’s showing you the truth from different people’s perspectives. It’s a really raw way of experiencing what you watch.
 “In this case, it’s really ironic that the voiceless were our elected representatives.”
 Twitter has long had a presence in Washington, and holds regular training sessions for politicians and media organizations on how best to use its tools. After Twitter bought Periscope, the video app was incorporated into the company’s training efforts.
 About a month ago, Twitter held a training session with the House Democratic caucus that focused specifically on how to use Periscope. A staff member from Mr. Peters’s office attended. On Wednesday, when C-Span lost access to cameras — which are normally shut off when the House is not in session — an aide suggested that Mr. Peters turn to Periscope as a means of broadcasting what was happening on the House floor.
 A Facebook spokeswoman said that broadcasts by members of the House had reached more than 2.9 million viewers on the social media site. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, wrote in a post on Thursday morning that use of Facebook Live was “bringing more openness to the political process.” Overnight ratings were not available for C-Span.
 Other networks shared brief segments from the live feeds, but it was C-Span that stuck with them, overriding other coverage and cutting away only when Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other House Republicans returned to the floor around 10 p.m. for a series of votes.
 C-Span is no stranger to late-night sessions — be they for a filibuster or a contentious vote — but the impromptu sit-in, which Mr. Murphy said the network had no advance knowledge of, was different. A staff of around 25 people remained overnight in the Capitol and at the network’s offices a few blocks away, and the regular morning team was called in four hours early.
 “It was the least scripted of the all-night sessions we’ve had to cover,” Mr. Murphy said.
 The fact that C-Span does not control the cameras inside congressional chambers has been a source of disquiet for the network since it arrived on the air in 1979. Every time a new leader comes to power in either chamber, Mr. Murphy said, network executives send a letter requesting greater access, including the placement of independent media cameras inside the chamber. Thus far, they have been denied.
 The network employs about 270 people and has an annual budget of $70 million, according to a spokesman, Howard Mortman. It enjoys a niche following: Journalists covering the federal government treat it as a lifeline, and for those addicted to politics from coast to coast, few sources can rival its unvarnished transmission.
 While C-Span’s decision to stick with the protest drew a flurry of criticism on Twitter, Mr. Mortman said there had been no serious concerns raised from Mr. Ryan’s office or outside groups.
 “We want to show as much of Congress as we can — that’s our mission,” he said. “This clearly is a big story, and this gives us a way to show what’s happening in an area where our own cameras are not allowed.”

7408,"CHICAGO — Jake Arrieta lost this week’s shot at a no-hitter on just his fifth pitch of the game Thursday.
 Five innings later, on a dank spring afternoon, the Milwaukee Brewers ended Arrieta’s home field scoreless streak at 522/3 innings, the second-longest such streak of zeros since the turn of the century before the last one, and the Cubs’ manager yanked him from the game.
 Arrieta sat afterward in the Cubs’ interview room, his piercing eyes, erect posture and thick black beard calling to mind a fierce Mennonite hurler. “I kind of backed myself into a corner,” he said of his performance. “It just wasn’t good from start to finish.”
 Before we panic, let’s keep in mind that this slacker Arrieta gave up all of three hits and a single run and struck out six men. The Cubs won, 7-2. His worst outing of the year pushed his E.R.A. from 0.77 to 1.00 per game.
 Oh, and Arrieta tossed a no-hitter in his previous start. He is — with apologies to parochial devotees of the blond-tressed Noah Syndergaard — the best pitcher in baseball, with no peer.
 “He’s 5-0,” noted his catcher, David Ross. “I think he’ll be O.K.”
 Arrieta’s modest attack of mortality Thursday might have a beneficial side effect, in that it might tamp down rumblings that his epic pitching run must be fed by steroids, EPO, human growth hormone or some chemistry combinations too obscure to name. Such rumblings come accompanied by not a shred of evidence, not an iota, nada, that Arrieta has used anything artificial.
 Arrieta says the accusations are laughable. He says he favors suspending for life players who are found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs.
 A shortage of fact was no bar for television’s hot air balloons. Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless, the Moe and Larry of ESPN, engaged in a one-plus-one-equals-five exercise this week. “I’m not going to accuuuse you of using performance-enhancing supplements, drugs,” Smith said of Arrieta, who was not on that show. “But you shouldn’t just be laughing at those who are looking at you and saying, Excuse me, what the hell is going on here?”
 Bayless nodded gravely. “I have no sympathy for him.”
 Let me back up. Ours is a suspicious age, and not without reason. We clap too hard for great athletes and we risk playing the fool. The path through the past decades is littered with writers who disabled their frontal lobes and defended the Popeye bodies and improbable accomplishments of Barry Bonds, Rafael Palmeiro, Mark McGwire, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, and the cyclist Lance Armstrong, not to mention hundreds of professional football players, sprinters, marathon runners and racewalkers.
 Just Friday, the National League’s reigning batting champ, Dee Gordon of the Miami Marlins, was suspended for 80 games for using steroids.
 That said, let’s return to the case at hand: No one has said Arrieta is anything other than a brilliant artisan of a pitcher, who mows lineups like a farmer wielding a scythe on tall grasses.
 Many suggest that Arrieta “came from nowhere,” a no-account shuffler become Tom Seaver. That oversimplifies. Arrieta was a top college pitcher and his first team, the Baltimore Orioles, considered him a potential ace, with a smoker of a fastball and a heartbreaking curveball.
 His control, however, was miserable, and his pitches ran when they should have cut. His E.R.A. scaled unsightly peaks. By 2014, the sharp-eyed crowd at Baseball Prospectus had all but given up. “Running Arrieta out every fifth day is just setting him up to fail,” the Prospectus opined. “The Cubs would be wise to find out if his stuff will play up in the bullpen.”
 As it happened, in 2015, Arrieta mastered his pitches and soared into the baseball troposphere. He won 22 games with a 1.77 E.R.A. He did this not by throwing five miles per hour faster. According to a FanGraphs analysis, his fastball this year is six-tenths of a mile per hour faster than it was in his last year in Baltimore. (Syndergaard of the Mets throws quite a bit faster than Arrieta).
 He returned to his old pitching motion, in which he uses his left shoulder to hide his pitch. “I used to bat against him in Baltimore,” Ross, the catcher, said. “He’s a different pitcher. His confidence is incredible.”
 Joe Maddon, the Cub manager and a beatnik of a baseball lifer, walked into the pregame conference wearing a T-shirt that read: “Do Simple Better.” (After the game, he wore a new T-shirt: “Try Not to Suck.”)
 If Arrieta were on the opposing team, I asked Maddon, how would you instruct your hitters? He wagged his head with the sympathy reserved for the soon to be executed. “Honestly, I have lots of thoughts but I’m not sure if any of the thoughts would work,” he said.
 The previous evening, I put that question to Ryan Braun, the star outfielder for the Brewers. He rolled his eyes. “The wind is blowing in, it’s raining and 45 degrees,” he said. “There are no circumstances under which I want to face Arrieta. I’m praying for a rainout.”
 The Gods cooperated, although the weather was little better the next afternoon. The Cubs claimed 32,734 attended that game, which was accurate only if ten thousand fans were hiding beneath the seats in this ancient stadium.
 The Brewers more or less surrendered. Their pitchers walked 11 men; their fumble-fingered fielders dropped pickoff attempts and double-play balls. The Cubs pounced like a lion on a lame antelope.
 Ross, a graying, 39-year-old journeyman, took a mighty swing and sent the ball bouncing into the streets beyond the bleachers. (“I was thinking: If that one doesn’t go out, that’s a sign I’ve got to retire,” he said). In the bottom of the first inning, Ben Zobrist, once a Kansas City Royal and now a Cub, stepped to the plate with the bases loaded.
 At this point, I invoke my privilege as a Mets fan who witnessed this man break the spirits of friends and family last autumn. Zobrist had a deeply annoying Royals-like at-bat, in which he fouled off many pitches before slapping a deeply annoying bleeder of a single to right field, knocking in two runs.
 Even with a mortal Arrieta on the mound, that was that. “We are in a spot,” Arrieta noted, “where we feel pretty good.”
 Even a few wild accusations aren’t going to change that.

5825,"Embracing the concept of “keep the change,” the Transportation Security Administration said it collected more than $760,000 in unclaimed cash — mostly loose coins — from travelers who had forgotten the money after passing through airport security in the 2015 fiscal year.
 The agency said it “makes every effort to reunite passengers with items left at the checkpoint,” but at times, property or loose change go unclaimed. The coins, for instance, were left behind when passengers emptied their pockets before going through metal detectors.
 Money from other countries collected over the fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, made up more than $9,200, which was converted to American currency, according to a T.S.A. report in March.
 What will the agency do with the money? In 2005, Congress gave the T.S.A. the authority to use unclaimed money on security operations.
 The money came from 114 so-called hub airports, central airports through which flights are routed. Money collected at smaller airports, which are connected to hubs via routes known as spokes, turn over the money they collect to their respective hub.
 In the New York metropolitan area, Kennedy International Airport reported the highest total of unclaimed funds: $43,715.81. La Guardia Airport reported $23,413.61, and Newark Liberty International Airport raked in $12,846.78.
 The lowest amount collected at a hub airport was $1.99, at Pago Pago International Airport in American Samoa, according to the T.S.A. figures.
 USA Today, which reported on the unclaimed money, said that some airports had installed kiosks for passengers to deposit spare change for charitable causes. Denver International Airport collects money for a program to help homeless people, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport accepts donations to support a United Service Organizations’ program for members of the military and their families.
 John Dedell, a video conferencing designer from Safety Harbor, Fla., said he flew about once a month for business and puts his loose change in a backpack for safekeeping.
 “It really does not surprise me that people leave loose change behind,” he said in an email. “People seem to leave all kinds of things, and I don’t think there has ever been a trip that I didn’t hear ‘Will the person who left ... come back to T.S.A. to retrieve it.’”
 A combination of fewer T.S.A. screeners, tighter budgets, new checkpoint procedures and more passengers has already created long lines at airports around the country.
 Money left unclaimed has nearly doubled, to $765,759.15 in the 2015 fiscal year from $383,413.79 in the 2008 fiscal year, the T.S.A. report showed. The sum has increased every year except for one since 2008.
 Look for more loose change to be left behind this summer as air travel reaches its peak. Officials warn of extraordinarily long waits to get through security, which might mean more anxious passengers dashing for their gates and forgetting to pick up their money.

101,"In his most expansive speech to date, Donald J. Trump laid out a case on Tuesday for tearing up trade pacts and confronting China as he stood at a recycling plant near Pittsburgh.
 Mr. Trump’s speech was perhaps the most forceful case he has made for the crux of his candidacy: not just that he is a businessman with a well-established personal brand, but that the days of globalism have passed, and that a new approach is necessary.
 He did not suggest change in tiny increments. Instead, he forcefully challenged the decades-old shibboleths of Republican economic orthodoxy as yoked closely to pro-business interests. Mr. Trump did not expressly describe his views as nationalist, but he did call for an era of economic “Americanism.”
 The speech was well delivered by a candidate who is still adjusting to the use of teleprompters. And it was the opening shot of a general election effort that is focused on winning states with large numbers of working-class white voters.
 Mr. Trump came under attack over the speech from the United States Chamber of Commerce and from Democrats. But such criticisms are unlikely to hinder a candidate who has already positioned himself as an outsider and a flamethrower. The question for Mr. Trump will be whether he can maintain the tone and focus of the speech going forward.
