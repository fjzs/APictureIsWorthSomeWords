"One of China’s biggest threats to an American technology leader just found life a lot tougher.
 Huawei Technologies, which over the last decade has become a leading global supplier of internet and communications gear, has been subpoenaed by the United States Commerce Department to turn over information about its sales to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, Paul Mozur writes.
 These countries are, in American eyes, outlaw states or places where the United States restricts exports of American gear, and the subpoena was issued at Huawei’s headquarters in Texas. It deals with exports of United States gear, which could mean things that Huawei made even in part in the United States.
 It couldn’t come at a worse time for Huawei. The Chinese company has 170,000 employees and annual sales of $60 billion, an increase of 50 percent in the last three years. Almost none of that comes from the American market, where Cisco Systems dominates sales of the computer switches and internet routers both companies sell.
 A congressional panel in 2012 named Huawei, along with another Chinese company called ZTE, a security threat, largely curbing its sales in the United States.
 Huawei has worked hard to be a good citizen since then, boasting about its business practices and respect for intellectual property. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of suing Samsung of China for stealing Huawei’s inventions in wireless technology.
 That amounted to a coming-out party for the company as a normal international technology player. Now the attention will turn to the Chinese habit of selling things to the enemies of the United States.
 More broadly, it is another example of the ways that governments appear increasingly willing to rein in tech companies, something Farhad Manjoo wrote about earlier this week.
 The borderless world, it turns out, still has some very powerful guard posts.

"BALTIMORE — The sky was still dark, and the rain was still pelting Pimlico Race Course, but by daybreak on Sunday, Team Nyquist had made up its mind: Its previously undefeated colt would head to Belmont Park for a rematch with Exaggerator, who a day earlier had vanquished his nemesis in the slop to win the Preakness Stakes.
 “Even the great Secretariat got beat,” Nyquist’s trainer, Doug O’Neill, said. “They’re not machines, as much as he would seem like a machine, being undefeated and doing everything like a superhorse.”
 Over in Exaggerator’s barn, the mood could not have been brighter. Keith Desormeaux, who trains Exaggerator, even arrived early for his morning news conference.
 There were, after all, many reasons to be happy. With Desormeaux’s brother Kent on Exaggerator’s back, the colt had finally reached the winner’s circle after having lost all four of his previous meetings against Nyquist, including a second-place finish in the Kentucky Derby. Now, Keith Desormeaux was full of energy.
 “The dream, honestly, is just having a horse that is consistent and has the ability to compete at this level,” he said. “We do our best, honestly, to prepare and hope and make sure that we’ve done all we can to get the horse to the race in the best shape.
 “Goodness, the actual feeling of winning, honestly, is still sinking in. I’ve been pretty good with these things all week, but I’m at a loss for words. I’m still processing it all.”
 Exaggerator, who had previously won two graded stakes on wet tracks, including the Grade I Santa Anita Derby on April 9, benefited from a sloppy track on Saturday, and by Nyquist’s having to duel with Uncle Lino through the fastest opening quarter-mile in Preakness history, at 22.38 seconds.
 “I wanted him to have a good, clean trip, free-running,” O’Neill said of Nyquist. “And the fast pace would be blamed on me, because I just didn’t want any traffic trouble going into the first turn.”
 After that, all Exaggerator had to do was sit back and wait for Nyquist to tire. Another strong closer, Cherry Wine, passed Nyquist as well and finished second, three and a half lengths back.
 “I was confident at the top of the stretch when he was moving up to the leaders without being asked,” Desormeaux said. “Kent was still sitting like it was in morning exercise. When he asked Exaggerator for his best, there had to be much left in the tank.”
 It was also a very good day for the Stronach Group, which owns Pimlico, and the Maryland Jockey Club. After talk of moving the Preakness to Laurel Park in Laurel, Md., cast an early pall over Preakness week, officials said a record crowd of 135,256 had attended the 14-race Preakness Day program, which generated a record handle of $94,127,434. NBC posted a 6.2 overnight rating, up 7 percent from 5.8 from 2015.
 Sal Sinatra, the president and general manager of the Maryland Jockey Club, said no decisions on the future of the Preakness would be made until the Maryland Stadium Authority completed a study to determine the viability of keeping the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico, the nation’s second-oldest track. The study is expected to take a year and a half, he said.
 In addition to Exaggerator and Nyquist, the probables for the Belmont Stakes are Cherry Wine and his stablemate Brody’s Cause (seventh in the Derby); Lani (fifth in the Preakness and ninth in the Derby); Suddenbreakingnews (fifth in the Derby); and Destin (sixth in the Derby).
 Exaggerator will be given a few days to recover at Pimlico before shipping to Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., for the mile-and-a-half Belmont on June 11. Nyquist will head there Monday.
 “We were saying last night, the motto is, ‘A new streak begins in three weeks,’ ” O’Neill said. “So it’s to get us motivated, as humans. I’m still very proud, but I was definitely visualizing a Triple Crown winner. That’s for sure.”
 Desormeaux could not be happier about playing spoiler. For him, he said, the pressure was already minimal, and now that Exaggerator had defeated his rival, there was even less.
 “I’m just an old country boy working in the trenches these last 30 years, and now we’re competing on the highest level,” he said. “My emotions are more toward gratitude and the satisfaction of getting to this level.
 “The rivalry or the fun, it’s there, but it doesn’t matter who is in the race. It’s the fact that we’re competing at this level.”

"Cecily Koppuzha’s parents were introduced to Lionel Sotomayor in October 2008, when he tried to contact them by cellphone from a Boston hospital.
 “Hi, this is Lionel, I’m a student at M.I.T. and I’m calling to tell you that Cecily was in an ice skating accident,” Mr. Sotomayor said nervously before his call was lost to poor reception.
 That call, made from the emergency room, marked the beginning of a painfully secret relationship forged by Ms. Koppuzha and Mr. Sotomayor, 18-year-old fellow Floridians and freshman classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 “I wasn’t sure if her parents received my message that day,” said Mr. Sotomayor, who is now 26 and working in Brooklyn as a transportation manager for Amazon, overseeing facilities in the Northeast. “When we got disconnected that day, I didn’t have time to call her parents again because Cecily was being treated and I needed to rush over to be at her side.”
 A few hours earlier, he and Ms. Koppuzha were enjoying their first date at a rink on the M.I.T. campus in Cambridge. When he challenged her to a race and sped off, she playfully clung to him before losing her balance and tumbled to the ice. As she rose to her skates, she noticed a small pool of blood beneath them.
 “His right skate blade had accidentally run over my left hand,” she said. “But it was so cold in there, I didn’t even feel it. I had no idea I was bleeding.”
 Now 26 and a physician, having received her medical degree last month from Florida International University, she recalled being whisked away in the back of an ambulance, where a paramedic asked her for some identification.
 “I told him I had left my ID in my bag at the skating rink and that the gentleman I was with probably had it,” she said.
 She was told that the same gentleman was now sitting in the front of the ambulance.
 “That was when I really started developing strong feelings for Lionel,” Dr. Koppuzha said. “He took it upon himself to look after me that day, which told me how loyal and caring he is, and from that moment on, I just felt so much closer to him.”
 Shortly after she was released from the hospital she realized that her parents, who are both internists in private practice, had been frantically trying to contact her from their home in Port Charlotte, Fla.
 “Needless to say, they were beside themselves,” she said. “But they’re both doctors, so when I finally told them what had happened with me and Lionel, and that my cut only required about five stitches, they got over it pretty quickly.”
 But what she failed to share with her parents was the kind of news that would have cut too deeply for stitches: “When they asked me about Lionel, all I told them was that he was just a friend,” she said. “If I had mentioned that we were dating, they would have been very upset, so I kept our relationship a secret.”
 Dr. Beena Koppuzha and Dr. George Koppuzha were born and raised in Kerala, a state in southwest India. They are Knanaya, Christians whose religious heritage traces back to Abraham and whose culture goes back to Jews of the Aramaic-speaking regions of Israel and Syria, who migrated in A.D. 345 to the Malabar Coast. The Knanaya do not believe in marrying outside the faith.
 When Cecily was just a year and a half old, her parents moved to the United States. The second of three daughters, she grew up in what she described as a “very strict Indian household,” where her parents insisted that their daughters do not date or marry outside of their tight-knit ethnic and cultural circle.
 “All I ever heard was that one day I was going to marry a nice Knanayan boy,” she said. “Well, Lionel is from a loud Puerto Rican family, so I knew my parents wouldn’t like it.”
 Still, Dr. Koppuzha, who was studying neuroscience, and Mr. Sotomayor, who was studying aerospace engineering, continued to date.
 “I was horrible at physics and he was horrible at chemistry,” she said. “We would tutor each other, and the more we worked together, the stronger our relationship grew.”
 But while Mr. Sotomayor’s parents were delighted to learn that he had taken her to his freshman pledge formal in November 2008, their son would remain a secret to the Koppuzhas for the next two and a half years.
 “We understand that every family is different, but we happen to be a diverse family that is loving and accepting of all cultures,” said Mr. Sotomayor’s mother, Nilda Correa, who teaches English as a second language at Kissimmee Middle School in Florida. “Cecily is a wonderful girl. As far as my husband and I are concerned, if you love our son, we love you.”
 By January 2011 Dr. Koppuzha decided to invite her parents and two sisters to Boston for what she described as a family get-together, but she had something else in mind.
 “At that point, not telling my parents about Lionel was becoming too difficult to handle, too much of a struggle,” she said. “I had brought up his name so many times in our conversations because I didn’t want to completely hide him, but I never told them we were actually dating.”
 “I was also feeling pressure from Lionel’s side of the family to talk to my parents about him,” she said. “So I figured it was just time, for everyone’s sake, to tell the truth.”
 She eventually met with her family at a hotel near campus. When the conversation turned to dating, the oldest of the three daughters, Ann Koppuzha, who had known about Lionel, asked their father what characteristics he valued in a future son-in-law.
 After listening to his answers — Catholic, Indian and good-hearted — Cecily jumped in and joked about how two out of three weren’t so bad. But then she turned serious and summoned the courage to admit that she and Mr. Sotomayor had long been an item.
 “My father took it surprisingly well,” Dr. Koppuzha said. “But my mother, she just went silent.”
 When the bride’s mother did speak, she did so in a rather terse manner. “Did you come to M.I.T. to study or to date?” she asked.
 “I’ll never forget those words,” said Dr. Koppuzha, who will begin a residency in emergency medicine next month at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.
 Neither will her mother.
 “I have to admit, I was very upset,” Dr. Beena Koppuzha said. “I didn’t say much to Cecily because it was a very unexpected conversation. I had no idea that the Lionel who called us when Cecily went to the hospital had been her boyfriend all along.”
 The next day Mr. Sotomayor met the Koppuzha family for dinner, and Cecily’s mother, by her own admission, was still in protest mode.
 “I think I said ‘Hi’ to Lionel, maybe, but I was still very reluctant to accept the situation,” she said. “It was upsetting to me that my daughter was probably going to marry someone from outside of our community.”
 Ann Koppuzha, who is three years older than her sister, said that while “Lionel was a great guy who was very down to earth, our parents were worried that Cecily, being so young, might lose sight of her academic goals.”
 “They wanted Cecily to go to medical school,” she said. “They didn’t want her relationship to be a distraction.”
 Later that year, Mr. Sotomayor received a surprise invitation from his intended’s parents, who asked him to Port Charlotte for Thanksgiving dinner.
 “At that point, my mother came around to realizing that Lionel was a significant part of my life,” Dr. Koppuzha said. “She finally began accepting him.”
 Though he was grateful for the invitation, Mr. Sotomayor said that the thought of visiting to his girlfriend’s childhood home and seeing her mother for the first time since that cold meal in Boston 10 months earlier “was definitely nerve-racking.”
 But this time around, he found her parents, especially her mother, warm and receptive.
 “They were so welcoming,” he said. “They asked about school and my family, they were genuinely concerned about me, and Cecily’s mom fed me lots of spicy food, which I had trouble handling at first. It was wonderful.”
 After graduating from M.I.T. in 2012, the couple began a long-distance relationship. He took a job as a systems engineer with Boeing in Los Angeles, and she headed for Florida International University.
 In May 2014, Mr. Sotomayor shortened the distance between them by taking a job at Amazon in Tampa, Fla., a four-and-a-half-hour drive from her. “At least we were back in the same state,” he said.
 The sacrifice that Mr. Sotomayor made to be closer to his fiancée was not lost on her mother.
 “I appreciate everything Lionel has done for my daughter,” she said. “He is a very smart and very humble person, and he and Cecily have been bringing each other joy for many years now.”
 The couple were married on May 21 at the 131-year-old St. James Catholic Cathedral in Orlando, Fla., the pews bursting with 354 guests, some from as far away as India, Canada, Puerto Rico and New York.
 Women of Indian heritage — and the groom’s mother — wore traditional gold earrings, necklaces and bracelets, and henna art on their arms and hands.
 After the exchange of vows, the Rev. Teófilo Useche, a Roman Catholic priest, wrapped a stole around the couples’ hands as he blessed their union.
 A few days before the wedding, the bride’s mother said she accepted seeing her daughter’s hand in his.
 “I must admit that Lionel and Cecily make a great team, and I know they will do well together in life,” she said. “From that very first day, when he called from the hospital to tell us that she got hurt, they have always been there for each other.”

"DULONG, China — The narrow valley is one of the most remote and pristine in China. Monkeys, Asian black bears and the rare goatlike takin roam through rain-soaked forests above a river the color of jade. In spring, hillsides are splashed with pink rhododendron blossoms. Until two years ago, snowfall on a mountain pass blocked vehicle access for many months each year.­
 Now, in this sliver of land on the eastern rim of the Himalayas, the government is building new roads, expanding telecommunications and encouraging commercial ventures to alleviate poverty. Li Yingchun, who used to hike five days over a snowcapped mountain range from a village here to attend a boarding school, said a new paved road that runs through a seven-kilometer tunnel slicing into the mountains had made life easier.
 But he worries about the impact on both the environment and society from the explosion of activity. Already, a state-owned enterprise has built at least two hydropower stations along the Dulong River. Hotels are springing up.
 “Where there is a road, there are cars,” said Mr. Li, 29, an ecologist who earned a master’s degree at a provincial university. “There is too much human activity.”
 Opened in 2014, the serpentine road has sheer drops, dizzying turns and rubble from rockslides. It has also cut travel time to the county seat — now a mere three hours rather than a full day’s rough drive along a 15-year-old dirt road, which was impassable in winter.
 The changes that have transformed so many parts of China are unfolding at warp speed in the Dulong River Valley. It is home to almost all of the country’s 7,000 ethnic Dulong, or Drung, one of the smallest of the 56 official national ethnic groups. The lifeline of this northwest corner of Yunnan Province is the Dulong River, which begins on the Tibetan plateau and flows through this valley into Myanmar, where it merges into the Irrawaddy. In Yunnan, the river runs 90 kilometers, or 56 miles.
 The Gaoligong mountain range has kept the Dulong valley secluded, separating it from the wider valley of the Nu River, where a mosaic of ethnic groups live.
 The ramparts of the Gaoligong challenged World War II pilots who flew over the Hump, transporting military goods from Indian bases used by the United States and its allies to Chinese forces battling the Japanese. Planes crashed in the region — the remnants of one are in a museum to the south.
 Those peaks no longer cut off this valley, where the Dulong have lived for centuries in hillside villages. It is not just the new road and tunnel that now connect residents here to the outside world. China Mobile has set up 4G cellular data service across much of the valley, and is not shy about advertising this on billboards. One sign on the approach from the mountains to the main administrative village, Kongdang, says, “Take a photo of the beautiful scenery, transmit it to the world.”
 By the words are images of the jade river and of a local woman with intricate indigo tattoos on her face, once a common sight here.
 The buildings in Kongdang are concrete blocks, and many were built or renovated a few years ago. They are painted orange and have a silhouette of a horned cow’s head, a Dulong totem. A cow statue sits at the town entrance.
 “The changes have been tremendous,” said Yang Yi, an ethnic Han man living in the Nu Valley who has been driving a passenger minivan between the two valleys for a decade.
 “Transportation, clothes, daily life — it has all been transformed,” he said. “If you came here a decade ago, you would recognize the Dulong from their colorful clothes. Around three to five years ago, they began wearing modern clothes.”
 Even President Xi Jinping noted the changes. In January 2015, Mr. Xi met with seven representatives of the Dulong in Kunming, the provincial capital, and spoke of “getting rid of poverty” and “building a moderately well-off society,” according to an official news report.
 The valley is still quiet, except for occasional bursts of construction. One paved road runs north from Dulong Town toward the Tibetan border, ending near Mr. Li’s hometown. Another goes to the border with Myanmar and no farther. In the last village is a red church; some Dulong are Christians, though most are animists.
 There is no frontier checkpoint. Along a dirt trail into Myanmar, the border is demarcated by nothing more than a small stone.
 With no paved roads leading out of the nearby villages in Myanmar’s Kachin State, ethnic Dulong there walk into this valley to sell herbs and vegetables.
 It is tourism that provincial and county officials want to sell to the outside world. Word of the valley’s beauty is trickling out, and international agencies have recognized the Gaoligong Mountains National Nature Reserve as a crucial biosphere. The new road has made visiting easier, even if the nearest airport is a long day’s drive away.
 One recent afternoon, three ethnic Han backpackers from central China sat in the last village by the Myanmar border. People from outside the valley, many from other Yunnan towns, have come to work in restaurants and other service businesses that are counting on a tourist boom.
 In the village of Pukawang, just south of the government town, a group of tourists from Shanghai drove up to a boutique riverside hotel, Green Cottage, opened in October by a Beijing entrepreneur — a poverty alleviation project supported by local officials.
 On a slope behind the hotel is the old village. The few remaining residents there sit in wooden homes with fire pits, sometimes drinking homemade corn whiskey.
 The hotel occupies half the new village. The village homes and hotel villas were all designed and built together around 2012.
 Officials gave families in Pukawang two new homes, one to live in and one to rent to the hotel company for use as guest villas. To each family, the hotel pays 5,000 renminbi per year, under $800. The hotel charges guests $25 to $75 per night for each of the 13 villas.
 “Living here is much better than where we were before,” Kong Mingqing, 21, said as he stood by the porch of his new family home behind the hotel.
 Few ethnic Dulong have lived outside the valley, but Mr. Kong is an exception. He left to study vehicle maintenance in Hunan Province, he said, but returned in 2013 because of financial problems.
 “When I came back, it had already been transformed,” he said. “I don’t think too much about the changes coming. Of course, there will be changes.”
 In Pukawang, the hotel has tried to employ villagers — part of the official plan to help raise local incomes — but has found that hard to do, said a manager, Yang Yubiao, an ethnic Bai from the Dali area.
 “The villagers said they were tired of the work,” he said. “They left after two to three days.”
 Three of the hotel’s nine employees are ethnic Dulong from elsewhere in the valley, and the rest are outsiders, Mr. Yang said.
 “Has the poverty alleviation plan succeeded?” he asked. “We’ve raised the awareness of the Dulong people here — how to communicate with outsiders, how to make money, how to live a better life.”
 But Mr. Yang also said he had heard that a couple of women in Pukawang had committed suicide a few years ago by drinking pesticide. He has a theory: “This was a primitive society,” he said. “Now the leap is happening too fast. Some of them cannot adapt.”

"It was a silent spring for saiga antelopes last year.
 Within a few weeks in May in Kazakhstan, a mysterious illness claimed the lives of more than 200,000 of the endangered animals, or over 60 percent of the species.
 This spring scientists and conservationists around the world waited anxiously to see whether the die-off would be repeated. Not only has May come and gone with no epidemic, but newly published results from an April census revealed that the saigas are making modest gains in population.
 In particular, the Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan, which was hit hardest by the epidemic, grew from 31,000 after the die-off to 36,000 by April, said Steffen Zuther, who coordinates the Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative, a large-scale conservation program in central Kazakhstan.
 “It’s fantastic news,” said Stephanie Ward, a representative of Britain’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, a partner in the conservation program. She attributed the population growth to the Kazakh government’s effort to combat poaching for meat and male saiga horns, which are prized in Chinese traditional medicine.
 “Some of us were worried initially that the saiga horn would go up in value and really put pressure on the remaining antelope,” Ms. Ward said, “but the Kazakh government has risen to the challenge.”
 The apparent success of antipoaching and conservation measures, however, has done little to expose the roots of last year’s disease outbreak, which in some cases killed off entire herds.
 Research in the past year has pinned the die-off on Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium that commonly causes disease in water buffalo, cattle and bison (though not at such a deadly rate).
 Still, the mystery remains. The bacteria naturally occur in the antelopes without causing a problem, said Richard Kock, of the Royal Veterinary College in London, who has been studying last year’s die-off.
 What caused the bacteria to suddenly become virulent last year is unclear. One possibility was weather, Dr. Kock said. Increased rainfall, he said, “seems to create conditions where the pathogen can thrive, or the host is stressed in a way that makes it easier for the pathogen to invade.”
 Another possibility: Changes in vegetation as a result of reduced grazing by wild horses and, later, livestock kept by nomads on the steppes as that way of life declined. The changes might have created environmental stressors that are not yet well understood.
 For now, conservationists say, the international community needs to continue protecting saigas through proven strategies like cracking down on poaching and expanding protected areas.
 Before the die-off, there were more than 240,000 Betpak-Dala saiga. To ensure that a future disaster doesn’t wipe out the species, the population should be closer to a million, said Michael Brombacher, who heads the Frankfurt Zoological Society.
 Mr. Zuther, of the conservation initiative, is optimistic. “These animals were around in the Pleistocene, thousands to millions of years ago, with woolly mammoths,” he said. “The saiga has this really good capability of bouncing back.”

"In a sharp and public escalation of its response to a raft of investigations, the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit political group tied to Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that it would refuse to comply with a subpoena issued by a New York State ethics panel.
 The letter, written by the group’s lawyer, Laurence D. Laufer, accused the ethics panel of a “blatantly political exercise” in seeking further information related to possible lobbying activities.
 The state panel, known as the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, has been investigating the activities of the Campaign for One New York since last year over concerns, voiced by good-government groups and in the news media, that the group may have violated state regulations by acting as a lobbyist without registering as one with the state. The group registered as a lobbyist in 2014, but did not do so in 2015.
 In the 12-page letter, Mr. Laufer argued that Campaign for One New York did not perform any lobbying activities in 2015, and therefore was not required to register. He questioned several aspects of the investigation, its timing and its targets, noting that the panel sought information related to potential lobbying of the State Legislature, the mayor and the City Council, but not to any potential lobbying of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
 “We will no longer cooperate with what has obviously become a blatantly political exercise by an agency whose very independence is deeply in question,” Mr. Laufer wrote in the letter, provided to reporters and addressed to the panel’s executive director, Seth Agata.
 Hours after receiving the letter, Mr. Agata suggested in a telephone interview that the panel would go to court to compel production of the documents, as early as next week.
 “We have the option of going into court,” he said, adding that “regulated entities” do not get to chose their regulators. “We want the documents and we want them now.”
 The letter, which provided some new details of the panel’s investigation, was the second time in two weeks that Mr. Laufer has accused a state investigative agency of a political motivation, amounting to a barely veiled suggestion that some of the inquiries targeting Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, in recent weeks were being orchestrated in Albany.
 In both instances, Mr. Laufer questioned the political motivation of leaks of information to the news media and suggested that any member of the ethics panel who shared confidential information would be guilty of a crime.
 “It’s an open threat,” said Mr. Agata, who declined to address the specifics of Mr. Laufer’s letter, saying he could not share details of the investigation. “I have one arm tied behind my back.”
 The panel’s investigation began in May 2015, according to the letter, with a request to interview Bill Hyers, who managed Mr. de Blasio’s 2013 mayoral campaign and who helped establish the Campaign for One New York, which the mayor created to promote his agenda, the following year. The basis of the inquiry appeared to be fund-raising materials used by the group, including those that were related to school issues and would require state approval. The materials suggested to the panel a possible intent by the group to lobby in 2015, as it had done the year before.
 Groups are required under state law to register with the panel within 15 days if they reasonably anticipate spending more than $5,000 on lobbying activities.
 But Mr. Laufer argued that the investigation had gone beyond its original scope and, in seeking information about fund-raising, had drifted outside the panel’s jurisdiction. And he said the timing of an earlier subpoena, served in August, suggested it had been drafted sometime after an April dinner with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and just before the former executive director of the ethics panel left at the end of July to rejoin the executive branch, and therefore could have been influenced by the governor’s office.
 A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo’s office said that its only knowledge of the investigation “is what has been reported in the news.”
 The mayor’s group will continue to cooperate with investigations into other aspects of Mr. de Blasio’s fund-raising, by the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, Mr. Laufer said.

"The rain misted down and I had two choices: the road up the hill, or the one alongside the river. I stood next to some kind of cement plant, most of it hidden behind a corrugated metal fence dripping with moisture. My pack pulled down on my shoulders. The river, engorged by two days of rain, roared and echoed against the mountains. A man in blue overalls emerged from behind a small Fuso truck.
 Like many people I’d encountered in Japan, he wanted to help me. I was grateful. I put roughly 25 percent of my Japanese language skills to work.
 “Sumimasen?” I said (Excuse me).
 “Hai?”
 “Tsumago?”
 He gestured down the road, I thought along the river. He said quite a few things that I didn’t understand. I thanked him and strode off, pack on back, hands on straps, rain on head.
 A half-hour later, after continuing along the river and then beneath a highway overpass, pressing against the wall because there was no shoulder, and then doubling back in confusion — this can’t be right — I found myself outside the same plant, beside the same fence, talking to the same man. He seemed mildly frustrated with me. He gestured again, and this time I went up the hill. Of course — when you have a pack on your back, the destination is always up the hill.
 I soon came into Tsumago, a beautifully preserved Edo-era town on the Nakasendo road in the Kiso Valley. I had wanted to visit for years — 35, actually — and had chosen to walk from the train so I could first experience the town as travelers had in the 19th century: on foot, the neat rows of wooden houses revealing themselves in diminishing perspective as I turned the corner. But it was 2011, so instead I entered via the parking lot, and had to negotiate my pack between an idling bus and a pair of vending machines featuring the image of Tommy Lee Jones.
 My obsession with Japan began in 1979 when my parents took me from our house in Brooklyn to see a show of woodblock prints at the Cooper Hewitt museum in Manhattan featuring works by the great landscape artist Hiroshige.
 The show featured prints from Hiroshige’s first famous series, the 53 Stations of the Tokaido, which chronicled life along the ancient coast highway that connected Edo, present-day Tokyo, and Kyoto.
 Traveling the road was an envied, once-in-a-lifetime experience, and those who got the chance availed themselves of spectacular views, local culinary delicacies, hot spring baths and other more carnal pursuits along the way. Those who couldn’t go, or wanted souvenirs to remember their journeys, bought prints like Hiroshige’s for roughly the price of a double serving of noodles.
 The strikingly modern designs, the warm hues of the skies and trees, the towns nestled in the mountains or by the sea, the raucous joy of the travelers, and the almost palpable sense of the seasons lit up something inside me — I stood there transfixed. I was soon spending hours trying to draw like Hiroshige. I became obsessed by all things Japanese — books, movies; I even took up Japanese fencing. The country had recovered from the war, but was not yet the economic powerhouse it would become in the 1980s — it was something of a blank slate for my imagination.
 This interest never quite faded away like others of adolescence. But over the decades, various events (college, jobs, children) seemed timed to prevent me from actually visiting Japan. Or maybe I just told myself that. I suppose, deep in my heart, I didn’t want modern reality to get in the way of my childhood fantasy land.
 So in 2011 when my wife and two children had finally had enough — Why don’t you just go? — I screwed up my courage and went, with one goal of recreating the Hiroshige experience. The Tokaido is mostly built over, but portions of the Nakasendo, which connects Tokyo and Kyoto via the interior, and which Hiroshige had also chronicled, are still preserved.
 The evening after my rainy wrong turn I clumped eagerly up the road from Tsumago to the town of Magome. I was in some kind of heaven that day, in either bright sunshine or cool, crisp shade, but was rarely out of earshot of a highway. At one point, deep in the woods, I encountered a vending machine (Tommy Lee Jones again). I had an iced coffee.
 Four years later, as I planned my return to Japan, I knew I had to travel beyond the populated heart of the country if I wanted to really replicate the world I had seen in those prints, going farther afield than Hiroshige himself.
 And so I chose the Kumano Kodo, a series of trails through deep forest and small towns on the Kii Peninsula several hours south of Osaka. It’s a religious pilgrimage that I came across in my obsessive reading. Pilgrims go to visit the numerous shrines along the way, worshiping the mountains themselves. They’ve done so since the sixth century. It’s said one can achieve spiritual powers by enduring the route’s physical challenge.
 Spirituality aside, this seemed to have everything I wanted: long walks deep in the woods, beautiful towns with little hotels promising hot baths, sake and great meals. The idea of going alone was intimidating (I could only imagine how little English was spoken) but I hated the idea of being part of a group with a guide. My Japanese obsession is a very private thing. And that’s when I discovered Oku Japan, and the self-guided tour.
 I found it online. The reviews were good. For $955, Oku would book my hotels and provide me with a step-by-step guide to the trail. The company, based in Cheshire, England, had an office in Japan with an emergency phone number; this made my wife feel better. I opted for a four-day, three-night hike, paying a little more for a single supplement, but less because I’d take care of my own train tickets with a Japan Rail Pass. Oku provided me with timetables.
 And so with my trusty pack on my back, I set off for my second trip to Japan.
 First I spent two days in Tokyo. I visited print galleries during the day and wandered Shinjuku at night — to a New Yorker, it felt like 20 Times Squares — where I was carried along in a swirl of crowds, neon, blaring pop music, screeching overhead trains, weird bird tweets at walk signs and the approaches of English-speaking touts who promised “100 percent naked women,” all the beer I could drink in 60 minutes or both.
 I deflected offers of the first by pointing to my wedding ring, and the second by feigning indignation and announcing that I did not drink. Then I went off in search of a quiet cocktail bar. I found several, including a tiny one in the decrepit but atmospheric Golden Gai section, where the bartender said I looked like Jack Bauer from “24.” I don’t, but the name stuck, and the other drinkers exclaimed “Goodnight, Jack Bauer!” in tipsy unison as I returned to the lantern-lit alley an hour or so later.
 At my inn in Kyoto, a package awaited from Oku Japan: my 12-page itinerary, a booklet detailing the Kumano Kodo with directions (I would be taking the Nakahechi route) and several beautiful laminated color maps with height elevations. I was all set. The next morning, having condensed my essentials and a few of my favorite books about Japan into a shoulder bag, I grabbed a boxed lunch at Kyoto Station and got on the Super Kuroshia No. 7 limited express, nonreserved car, as per my instructions.
 I studied my itinerary and maps as the outskirts of Kyoto and then Osaka gave way to small towns and finally, the blue expanse of the Inland Sea, dotted with tiny islands as jagged and numerous as those portrayed by Hiroshige. The train hugged the west coast of the peninsula before arriving at the town of Kii-Tanabe, where I got off and found the bus that would take me into the interior.
 As I got on, I noticed a group of Westerners who seemed to be following the same instructions. This was something I had not considered: Others would be taking the same self-guided tour at the same time and I would be, by default, part of a group.
 The bus climbed away from the cluttered coastline into rich green mountains, and eventually along a wide, pebbly river. Soon enough, and right on time, we were in Takijiri, a tiny town in a deep ravine at the intersection of the Tonda and Ishifune rivers where the Kumano Kodo begins.
 I paid the 960 yen (about $8.80) Oku had prepared me for, and went into a shop to get water and a bamboo walking stick. I also wanted to let the others get ahead of me.
 I followed my instructions. The first shrine, Takijiri oji, was just behind the shop. I walked toward it, and then to the left around it, and saw the beginning of the trail, a sharply ascending ladder of logs and tangled tree roots, slick with damp leaves, beside a steep drop-off. Up I went.
 Have I mentioned that I’m not much of a hiker? Beyond my Japanese-fencing phase, athletics have never been a priority. I’m not outdoorsy; I’m indoorsy. But my Hiroshige fantasy propelled me onward, even as my chest started to ache awfully soon.
 I’m also a little anxious about heights. This was an issue that first day, and on the subsequent two days, as the trail was often atop a towering cliff on the right side, the left side, or at a few spots, both sides, the path crowning a precipitous land bridge. At one point, I kicked a small rock to determine how long it would take to the reach the bottom. It was still bouncing down, on and on, more and more distant, when I resumed my trek.
 I got into a rhythm, marking my progress on my map and at every wooden trail marker. Oku explained the history and legends associated with this or that shrine or landmark, kept me from taking several wrong turns, and warned me away from a detour that, while promising a great view, would have been exhausting. And anyway, there were already views at every break in the trees — layers and layers of mountains, some smooth, others rough with treetops, their ridges meeting in diagonal lines, each a different shade of green-blue.
 The first day was only 2.8 miles. Soon I descended into the tiny town of Takahara. Here two roads met on a gliding slope, and there were a few shops and one hotel, the Organic Hotel Takahara Kiri-no-sato. Every room in the place, from the wide-open lobby-dining room with its bare support beams to the men’s and women’s baths to the bedrooms, had spectacular views of the yawning valley below, now tinted gold.
 I tossed my bag in my room and went to have a beer and take some notes on the terrace. The afternoon cooled: The instant the sun dipped behind the mountains, it felt as if the valley became air-conditioned. I found the group from the bus, beers half-empty, one of the women with a laptop, and discovered that after my solitary train-bus-walk day, I didn’t mind a little company.
 After a bit I went for a bath, joined in the wooden tub by two chatty and elderly Japanese men, and enjoyed the view of the darkening mountains some more before getting dressed for dinner, set for precisely 6:30 p.m.
 One member of the group, Janet, invited me to sit with them, and I liked the idea, but my hosts said this would be impossible: We were different parties, after all. Sometimes in Japan, I’ve found, rules can be intractable. So I ate alone — pickles, beef I dipped in boiling water, and several other items including a very western avocado dish — at the next table over, my back to the others. It was equal parts awkward and comic. “How are you doing over there, Wendell,” Janet asked at one point over her shoulder.
 The rules were relaxed as the meal ended, and I shifted my chair around and joined the other table as I finished my sake (not included in Oku’s fee). There were five of them: Janet; her husband, Stan; her aunt Elvina; her colleague Pat; and Pat’s friend, also named Pat.
 We traded the basic details of our lives. They were from Canada, Edmonton and Vancouver, with jobs that included judges and lawyers in family court. It made for fascinating after-dinner conversation. They were also fierce hikers, having tackled many ambitious walks, such as the Camino de Santiago in Spain. They were indeed following Oku’s instructions, and had found the first day’s walk a snap. “Have you seen the elevations for tomorrow, and the day after?” one asked me.
 I had and said that I was worried.
 The second day’s hike was 6.5 miles, including 1,575 feet of ascent. I went down to the village to take in the view from there, and to allow the Canadians to get a head start; I still envisioned my hike as a solitary adventure. Soon enough I was deep in the woods, marveling at the towering and straight-up Japanese cedars and passing an abandoned house that looked like something out of a Japanese horror movie. Some trees were flecked with early-autumn orange. I sat on a stump to eat two sandwiches the Organic Hotel had packed for me for lunch.
 At one point I paused beside an especially deep ravine. The cedars stood like an infinite army of stoic and towering sentries all around and above and below me, endless legions of them, falling away on my hill and then rising higher on the next one, their tops shimmering gently way, way up there in the occasional breeze. A few beams of sunlight slanted down, but otherwise all was in shade. There wasn’t a sound, not a bird, not a cricket; even the branches swaying in the breeze could not be heard, as if they were in a silent movie.
 My hiking senses sharpened. I came to learn that a glimpse of blue sky near the bottom of the trunks ahead meant I was reaching the crest of a mountain, just as the increasingly loud gurgle of a stream meant I was reaching the bottom. There always seemed to be more up than down.
 I encountered the occasional solitary hiker flying by with scissoring poles, pilgrims with twinkling bells, and small groups. One was a gaggle of young women from Osaka who asked me to take their picture, asked me to appear in a picture with them, and gave me as a reward a selection of Japanese candies. After they thanked me and I absent-mindedly responded “Sure,” they engaged in a contest to see who could best imitate my voice, each attempt getting deeper and of longer duration. “Sure.” “Sure.” “Suuuuure.”
 At another point I was joined by a retired Japanese man who spoke nostalgically of the months he’d spent in Indiana studying engineering. He practiced his English on me while I practiced my Japanese on him. (Sumimasen?)
 Oku had warned that the Kii Peninsula could be rainy, but I never had anything but sun. My stamina followed an arc: I tired quickly, then got into a rhythm, magically energized. I felt my mind open up and go free — it wandered through time, over that print show at the Cooper Hewitt, my family, my first trip to Japan, even my job: Solutions to several vexing problems at work suddenly became clear.
 I tired again as I approached my destination, the town of Chikatsuyu, where Oku had booked me at a minshuku, a guesthouse, more modest than a traditional Japanese inn. It sat on the far bank of the Tonda. I had another long, hot bath, this one fed by a hot spring, again with two chatty and elderly Japanese men, though not the same ones as the evening before.
 I threw in once and for all with the Canadians at dinner. Maybe I’d already tired a little of my own thoughts. We agreed to stick together the next day. Another group at the guesthouse was from Spain, including a stocky bald man said to be a karate expert.
 We started early the following morning — Elvina was soon way ahead — and marked our progress on our maps. We had lunch in a small field next to a stream: I had two rice balls I’d bought at a shop in Chikatsuyu and an egg that Elvina made me take from the hotel, saying she was worried I wouldn’t have enough for lunch.
 We saw some wildlife. A snake zipped between the feet of one of the Pats. Three monkeys ruffled branches down a hill, warning us off with ghastly shrieks. And a deer with two short, single-pronged antlers and a straight-up white tail froze on the trail ahead of us. I reached for my camera but not quickly enough: the karate master bounded up from behind — “Qué pasa?” — and the deer bolted into the cedars as if it had been launched from a catapult.
 The Canadians paid more attention to hiking times and progress than I did. I learned a lot from them, like how each of the many shrines we passed had a small box containing a stamp and an ink pad. Or how I shouldn’t swing my hands when I hiked, because they could become swollen. In return I shared some of the many small facts I’d picked up about Japan in my decades of reading, like that the soft-boiled egg with a velvety texture that we’d had at breakfast was an “onsen egg” cooked in a hot spring.
 “Where did you learn that?” Janet asked me.
 “I don’t know. It’s just one of the obscure facts I picked up in the last 35 years.”
 That day’s hike was the longest at nine miles with roughly 2,000 feet of ascent. I was glad for that extra egg. This was the moderate option suggested by Oku; it included a quick bus ride. There was an easier option with a longer bus ride but that felt like cheating. Eventually, we came out of the forest and walked along paved roads in little farming towns. The hike ended in the magnificent Grand Shrine at Hongu, a key stop for many of those mountain-worshiping pilgrims. The shrine’s low-slung wooden buildings sat atop a towering stone staircase limned by hundreds of white flags blazing with Japanese characters, a fittingly dramatic finale.
 That night’s accommodation was a modern hot springs hotel. I had a bottle of Kirin from the refrigerator in my room before sampling all the various sulfur-smelling baths. I bathed inside, I bathed outside, and after a farewell dinner with the Canadians, found one of two private baths unoccupied, so I bathed there, too, finally alone.
 These baths were in a little house, the damp wood wall that separated them open near the ceiling. Two Japanese women — a mother and a daughter, I suspect — had gone into the other one as I went into mine, and I listened groggily in the near darkness to their mellifluous words and laughter, and occasional tiny splashes, as I sat in the steaming water up to my neck.
 If Hiroshige could see me now.
 The emotions I experienced after my first trip to Japan in 2011 — and here my parents and children might want to skip ahead — were distinctly similar to those I’d experienced after losing my virginity: something I’d imagined a million times had now taken place, and while it wasn’t exactly as I’d expected, it was still pretty great, and I was now a different person.
 And I wanted to do it again.
 My second trip made it all feel more real. The fantasy Japan of color woodblock prints and black-and-white movies was being replaced by the actual country. Those little encounters, with the gang at the Golden Gai bar, the hiker from Indiana, the men in the baths, a friend I met for lunch at Tokyo Station on my two-day race back to Narita Airport and home, brought Japan ever so slightly into focus.
 Hiroshige probably never visited the Kii Peninsula. In fact, recent scholarship suggests he never even traveled the length of the Tokaido, creating some of his most famous designs from guidebooks. I don’t know and I don’t care: I’m certain that in those solitary moments deep in the woods, my mind free, the cedars like endless rows of sentries, as I walked a path worn smooth by pilgrims 1,400 years ago, the silence complete, enveloping, I saw him.

"HOUSTON — For some of the thousands of American soccer fans who steadfastly chanted, “U-S-A! U-S-A!” down to the final, desultory minute of their team’s sobering thrashing by Argentina on Tuesday night, it might be just fine if the United States never played the Argentines again. The loss seemed that bad.
 Still, a few minutes after it ended, after his team had endured the 4-0 rout in a Copa América Centenario semifinal, Coach Jurgen Klinsmann spotted Sunil Gulati listening in at his news conference and expressed the exact opposite sentiment.
 He asked Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, for more.
 “I see Sunil sitting there,” Klinsmann said. “If ever we can get a friendly with Argentina, please do it. With Brazil, please do it. Even if we get lessons here and there, that’s part of our process. You’ve got to take those teams on in order to learn.”
 What Klinsmann, those American fans and millions more watching on television learned Tuesday night was that there remains a huge talent gap between Argentina and the United States.
 Klinsmann called the defeat — a thumping so complete that his team did not record a shot — a lesson and a pill to be swallowed. But he said he still believed that the only way to bridge that divide was to play top teams more often. He called his players far too respectful of Argentina and charged that they did not truly believe they could compete with the team, which FIFA has ranked No. 1 in the world.
 But perhaps his most stinging criticism was expressed with an air of disgust.
 “We are too nice,” Klinsmann said with a sneer, “too nice in those moments.”
 Klinsmann said he was desperate to see his players push back, get tough, step on toes, as he put it, and not back down in awe of Argentina’s Lionel Messi, or anyone else.
 Gulati was more matter-of-fact. “We were badly beaten,” he said, “by a very good team.”
 The only remedy in the long term, Klinsmann said, was more tests. He said he was eager for the team to be invited back to the Copa even at the short-term cost of more results like Tuesday’s.
 “Yes, no doubt about it,” he said. “These are the tournaments that will move us forward. These are the competitions that you need to play in order to grow.”
 Yet in the two most recent games pitting the top teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean (Mexico and the United States) against top teams from South America (Chile and Argentina), the combined score was 11-0. In each match, the North American team looked overmatched from the first whistle to the last.
 Still, Klinsmann looked hard for positives. He said he had told the players they should feel proud of the overall achievement, of winning three games and reaching the semifinals, which had been Klinsmann’s goal before the tournament.
 “We are very grateful to this Copa América to be a part of it,” he said. “We made it to the final four. There will always be a step backwards and then two more forward.”
 The only other time the United States reached the semifinal stage of the Copa América was in 1995. Otherwise, the Americans’ biggest semifinal appearance before Tuesday might have been at the 1930 World Cup.
 Tuesday offered a chance for the Americans to reach their first Copa final, but they failed badly.
 Michael Bradley, the captain of the United States team, said after the match that he could barely see past the disappointment.
 “Nobody has the sentiment that just because you get to the semifinal you are playing with house money,” he said. “It doesn’t work like that. The idea was to take it another step further and get to a final. For that reason, there is big disappointment. Ultimately, as time goes on a little bit, I think we can take a lot of positives from the tournament.”

"Evan Longoria and Curt Casali homered off David Price, and the Tampa Bay Rays chased Price, an ex-teammate, in the fourth inning to beat the Red Sox, 12-8, on Thursday in Boston.
 The Rays gave up five runs in the first inning but scored six in the fourth to take a three-run lead. The score was tied at 8-8 in the eighth when Steven Souza Jr. doubled home the go-ahead run.
 The Rays, who entered the game with the fewest runs scored in baseball, topped their previous season high of seven.
 Erasmo Ramirez (4-0) struck out Mookie Betts with the bases loaded in the seventh, then pitched out of a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth. Alex Colome got two outs for his third save.
 William Cuevas, making his major league debut, pitched two and a third innings and allowed two runs on three hits and two walks for Boston.
 DIAMONDBACKS 6, GIANTS 2 Yasmani Tomas hit a go-ahead home run in the fourth, Paul Goldschmidt drove in two runs, and visiting Arizona beat San Francisco for a four-game sweep.
 Tyler Wagner (1-0) allowed two hits in five relief innings of Shelby Miller as Arizona wrapped up a 7-3 road trip with its fifth straight win and the first four-game sweep ever in the Giants’ 17th-year ballpark.
 Johnny Cueto (3-1) was tagged for his first loss since joining the Giants on a $130 million, six-year contract.
 DODGERS 2, BRAVES 1 Yasmani Grandal doubled in the go-ahead run in the 10th inning, and Los Angeles overcame Clayton Kershaw, beating host Atlanta.
 Enrique Hernandez singled with one out against Alexi Ogando (1-1) and scored on Grandal’s shot off the center-field wall. Chris Hatcher (2-1) worked a scoreless ninth before Kenley Jansen earned his seventh save.
 Kershaw entered the game with a 1.64 E.R.A. The Braves got to the three-time Cy Young winner for 10 hits in eight innings, only the fourth time in 246 career starts that he had given up double figures. He struck out 10.
 MARLINS 5, NATIONALS 1 Ichiro Suzuki had two hits, scored twice and made two sliding catches in right field for host Miami, which used a makeshift lineup to beat Max Scherzer and Washington.
 Suzuki, 42, batted leadoff for the first time this season and started in right field for the slumping Giancarlo Stanton, who was given the day off.
 Also sitting out for the Marlins at the start of the series finale were Dee Gordon and J. T. Realmuto. But the lineup shake-up produced four runs in the first two innings against Scherzer (2-1).
 MARINERS 10, INDIANS 7 Robinson Cano hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning off Cody Allen, lifting visiting Seattle over Cleveland.
 Cano had an early single and then a run-scoring double in the sixth before connecting with two outs for his sixth home run this season. He had been hitless in seven previous at-bats against Allen (0-1).
 Tony Zych (1-0) pitched the ninth for his first major league win. Steve Cishek worked the 10th for his second save in two days.
 TWINS 8, BREWERS 1 Ricky Nolasco struck out seven and allowed five hits over six-plus innings, and visiting Minnesota ended a season-opening seven-game road losing streak by beating Milwaukee.
 Nolasco (1-0) allowed a run-scoring double to Ryan Braun in the first before settling down and retiring 16 of the next 18 Brewers hitters.

"GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP, N.J. — After Natalie Gulbis finished her rounds on Friday and Saturday at the ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic, dozens of fans lined up near the green to interact with her. As Gulbis walked off the course, she signed autographs, posed for photos and engaged in small talk with anyone who approached.
 “Can we get a picture with my daughter?” one woman asked on Saturday.
 “Yeah, of course,” Gulbis said.
 Despite her 441st placement in the women’s world golf rankings, Gulbis remains among the sport’s most popular and affable players. This was her seventh consecutive appearance at this event, although she was hoping she would not be here this year. Gulbis and her husband, Josh Rodarmel, are eager to start a family.
 “I’ve been trying to have a baby,” Gulbis said. “I’ve gone through a whole bunch of different ways to try to have children.”
 For now, Gulbis, 33, is still on the L.P.G.A. Tour, albeit on a reduced schedule. She returned to competition in April after a nearly seven-month absence. So far this year, she has missed the cut in each of her five tournaments. She shot a one-over-par 143 this weekend and failed to make the cut for the fifth consecutive year in this three-round tournament.
 Gulbis said she did not know how much longer she would compete. If she becomes pregnant and has a child, she may decide to retire.
 “I think I want to stay home, but I love golf, so I want to stay around golf,” she said. “If I have the opportunity to do something in golf, it’s part of me. Golf’s in my blood. I’ll be around here doing something, I’m sure.”
 Gulbis has juggled the demands of playing and pursuing off-course activities since she turned professional in 2001 after her freshman year at the University of Arizona. She was once among the sport’s most promising prospects. She competed on the United States Solheim Cup teams in 2005, 2007 and 2009.
 Still, even back then, she had higher ambitions than simply winning. She served as a paid endorser and spokeswoman for several brands. She also appeared in her own reality show on Golf Channel and in the second season of NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice,” which was hosted by Donald J. Trump.
 Last week, Gulbis wrote an article for Golf.com about her experiences with Trump and their shared passion for golf and business. She wrote that she last saw him at last year’s British Women’s Open, where they discussed Turnberry, the site of the tournament and the course that Trump owns. Trump also asked Gulbis about Lydia Ko, 19, the top-ranked women’s player.
 “As usual, he wanted to know more about winners,” Gulbis wrote. “That never-ending desire to learn more about and from the best in any field, that’s the Donald Trump I know.”
 Gulbis, whose only L.P.G.A. Tour victory came in 2007, has battled numerous injuries and ailments the past few years. She has had three back operations and contracted malaria in early 2013. Later that year, she finished tied for ninth at the British Women’s Open, her last top-10 finish. Since the start of the 2014 season, she has missed the cut or withdrawn in 19 of 31 tournaments.
 “If you do anything in 15 years and you live a public life, it’s going to get documented,” Gulbis said. “It just happens. Athletes get sick and they get injured, and we travel all over the world. The fact that I would catch something is no surprise. But I feel great now, knock on wood.”
 During Friday’s opening round, she showed some promise with five birdies en route to a two-under-par 69, which was five shots off the lead. It was her first below-par round since last July, a span of eight tournaments.
 The next day, Gulbis teed off on the 10th hole and made birdie before carding three bogeys and a triple bogey on her front nine. She then had two birdies for a two-under 35 on her back nine, but she still missed the cut by two strokes.
 Still, Gulbis seemed satisfied to be out on the course and around some of her longtime tour colleagues, including Christina Kim, 32, whom she has known since they were young rivals in Northern California.
 Although Gulbis and Kim are no longer in their prime, they were among the most popular players this weekend. They took their turns after rounds to speak with fans and fulfill their requests, which the former L.P.G.A. Tour players Beth Daniel, Meg Mallon, Juli Inkster, Nancy Lopez and others encouraged them to do when they were first starting out.
 “As we got our cards on tour, we were taught to respect our spectators, respect our sponsors, because without them, we wouldn’t have these events,” Kim said.
 Kim added, laughing, “Even though you’re not necessarily having the best day, there are still people that are coming out and basically wasting their time watching us.”
 The crowds following Gulbis this weekend saw a player who looks familiar but deals with unseen pain because of her past injuries. She said she typically arrives at the course two hours before her tee time and does warm-up exercises for her back for an hour.
 And yet, she’s still out there with the same caddy (Greg Sheridan) she has had for 12 years and the same coach (Butch Harmon) she has had for 15. On the side, she makes sponsor appearances, raises money for charities and hosts a television show with Jimmy Hanlin on Fox Sports regional networks.
 For now, though, those are just part-time projects. She remains a golfer who is not sure how much longer she will be on tour.
 “I feel like, in 2010, I started counting down years,” Gulbis said. “I got told that I should retire in 2010 because of my back. I don’t know. I try not to plan it because you just don’t know. I don’t know. If I’m fortunate enough to be able to play, I love playing. And if I’m pregnant, I probably won’t be playing.”

"The big news of the theater world this week will be the list of Tony Award nominees, set to be announced at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
 But even before the nominators speak, the market is expressing its views on the season, now that all of the new shows have opened.
 The top-grossing new musical last week, by a long shot, was “Hamilton,” followed by “School of Rock,” “On Your Feet!” and “Waitress.” The top-performing new play was “The Humans.”
 The top-performing musical revivals were “The Color Purple” and “Fiddler on the Roof,” while the top-performing play revival was “The Crucible.”
 Among the shows that could really use a Tony-nomination boost are the new musicals “Bright Star,” “Tuck Everlasting” and “Disaster!”
 Overall, the week ending May 1 was a strong one for Broadway, because it was a vacation week for New York City public schools. The 37 plays and musicals now running grossed $28 million, up $1.2 million from the week before, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League. The current Broadway season is now grossing 0.7 percent more than last season, and attendance is up 1.6 percent.
 The grosses for several shows were affected by free tickets given to journalists, Tony voters and opening-night guests.
 Among the latest openings, “Waitress” is looking especially strong; it grossed $907,936 in eight performances last week and played to sold-out houses all week. And Cirque du Soleil’s Broadway debut, “Paramour,” continues to do very well in previews, earning $1,065,771 in six performances last week; that show is scheduled to open on May 25, making it the first show of the 2016-17 theater season.

"HONOLULU — Anna Sullivan is prohibited from sitting on a sidewalk. She cannot wander off to find food without worrying that the police might seize her shopping cart. She cannot sleep on Waikiki Beach without fear of being rousted.
 Ms. Sullivan, 45, has been homeless for eight years since she got out of prison. But these days — after run-ins with the police over where she sleeps, sits or leaves her belongings — she tries to keep away from Waikiki, the bustling tourist district whose sidewalks and beaches she once used as her home.
 “Tickets, tickets, tickets,” she said, already looking weary at the start of her morning, sipping a cup of iced coffee as she sat on a bench by the beach. “The cops give you a ticket to keep you moving. And then you have to pay the ticket for sleeping in the park. It gets to you.”
 Two years ago, Honolulu, for all its opulence and appeal to tourists, was a nationally known hub of homelessness: people sprawling on benches and sidewalks, panhandling, guarding piles of tents and clothes, sleeping in doorways and moving around aimlessly. Business leaders described the atmosphere as a fundamental threat to the tourist-based economy.
 But these days, the homeless who had crowded large parts of this city are, to a considerable extent, gone.
 The change came after Honolulu responded with force to what the governor described as a state of emergency, passing tough criminal laws aimed at ridding sidewalks, streets and parks of the homeless. At the same time, the city sent teams of social workers out to help the homeless move into shelters. And the tourist industry put up money to cover airfare for homeless people who had come from the mainland and who said they were ready to go home.
 Now it is possible to spend hours wandering Waikiki and Chinatown, two historic neighborhoods where hundreds of homeless people once settled, and encounter only the occasional reminder that Hawaii has the highest per capita homeless population in the nation.
 A battery of laws that effectively criminalize homelessness is sweeping the nation, embraced by places like Orlando, Fla.; Santa Cruz, Calif.; and Manchester, N.H. By the end of 2014, 100 cities had made it a crime to sit on a sidewalk, a 43 percent increase over 2011, according to a survey of 187 major American cities by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty. The number of cities that banned sleeping in cars jumped to 81 from 37 during that same period. There have been laws outlawing panhandling and authorizing the removal of tent camps.
 Honolulu’s mayor, Kirk Caldwell, coined the phrase “compassionate disruption” to describe what the city is doing, because the measures are accompanied by outreach programs.
 But there seems little doubt among city officials and the homeless themselves that the change on the streets is primarily a result of the laws that permit the authorities to tell people to stop sitting on sidewalks, and to seize belongings that are illegally piled on public land.
 The crackdown comes amid the gentrification that is transforming cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Honolulu, contributing to higher housing costs and increased homelessness. “You know what they say the state bird of Hawaii is?” asked Eric John Odegaard, 44, who has been homeless most of his life, gesturing to the growing Honolulu skyline. “The crane.” Mr. Odegaard sleeps in the nearby mountains.
 In Honolulu, the most recent homeless law made it illegal to sit or lie on sidewalks, with criminal penalties if warnings are ignored in Waikiki, the tourist district, and in Chinatown. That followed laws that let the authorities seize the belongings of homeless people left in public spaces, and that closed down many parks and beaches at night. So far, there have been only a handful of arrests; the strategy here is to use the threat of tickets and jail to prod homeless people to go someplace else.
 “I would tell you emphatically that it’s working really, really well,” said George Szigeti, the head of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. “The No. 1 reason that people were saying they would not come back to Hawaii was because of homelessness.”
 Some social workers say that the specter of enforcement makes it easier to persuade the homeless to try a night in a shelter bed or enter a drug treatment program. Other advocates have sued the city over some of its approaches.
 For all the applause from the tourist industry and City Hall, the Honolulu experience appears to be more of a salve to the concerns of civic leaders than a solution to finding a bed for those without a place to live. In 2015, the Department of Housing and Urban Development counted 7,620 people as homeless in Hawaii, whose population totals 1.4 million. The vast majority of the homeless are in Honolulu, on Oahu.
 While homeless people have largely vanished from the areas that were the focus of the crackdown, many have just gone elsewhere, into the dense greenery up Diamond Head Road, to out-of-the-way alleys and remote corners of public parks.
 In interviews, homeless men and women displayed a mastery of the intricacies of state and city laws, of how some sidewalks are covered and others are not and of how beaches open at 5 a.m., allowing a few hours to sleep before it gets too hot. They know not to smoke a cigarette on a beach or push a shopping cart along the sidewalk in Waikiki, prohibited activities which will draw the attention of the police.
 “We had to go from the state side of the street to the city property,” said Brian Bowser, 36, who has been homeless since 1995. “We just do our best.”
 Hawaii has among the highest per capita living costs in the country; there are not many places where the indigent can afford to live. “You see tents going up everywhere,” said Victor Geminiani, the executive director of Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, an advocate of homeless people. “It’s just a matter of Whac-a-Mole.”
 Ernie Martin, the chairman of the Honolulu City Council, said he voted reluctantly for the sidewalk law, known as the sit-lie measure, and saw it as a stopgap. “At the end of the day it doesn’t matter: We can sit-lie the whole island if we want,” he said. “The population has to go somewhere. We can’t push them into the ocean.”
 The sidewalk ordinance took effect at the end of 2014, and through March 1 of this year the police had issued 16,215 warnings and written 534 summonses, according to city officials.
 “People moved because they were being harassed,” said Dan Foster, 49, who has been homeless since coming from Oregon more than a year ago. “Between dealing with cops and legal authorities, they’d rather just go so they don’t have to deal with it. I think it’s a violation of our constitutional rights, our right to sit places and sleep where we choose. But you know what? I understand. There’s a lot going on out here.”
 The City Council last year expanded the sit-lie ordinance to include 16 neighborhoods, putting more territory off bounds. Asked whether he would advise other cities to embrace the approach, Mr. Caldwell responded without hesitation. “Yes,” he said.
 “Sit-lie is not about homelessness,” Mr. Caldwell said, as he took a visitor on a tour around the city, pointing out the new high-priced condominiums rising over boulevards where tents and homeless outposts once lined the street. “Sit-lie is about commerce. It’s about keeping sidewalks open for people to do business.”
 Across town the next morning, police officers monitoring a bank of surveillance cameras at the Chinatown substation spotted Darlin Abelaye, who has lived most of her 55 years on the streets here. She was settled in front of a liquor store, her legs splayed, struggling to light a cigarette. By sitting down, she was violating the 16-month-old city ordinance.
 Moments later, Ms. Abelaye looked up as two officers approached on Maunakea Street. She peered up the empty sidewalks and rose unsteadily. By now, she knew where to head when the police came. “I’ll go to Aala Park,” she said. “That’s where I’ll sleep.”
 Kaka’ako is a retail neighborhood two miles up the shoreline from Waikiki, and not a place where tourists tend to stray.
 Last summer it became a flash point in Honolulu’s campaign to rid the streets of the homeless. Sidewalks and patches of grass were covered with tents, sleeping bags, shopping carts, folding chairs and piles of belongings. Merchants and residents in Kaka’ako complained that the influx was a result of the campaign to push people out of Chinatown and Waikiki.
 And so, a week after Labor Day, teams of city sanitation workers showed up, carrying brooms and shovels. They were followed by garbage trucks. As the police and the homeless looked on, the workers cleared the sidewalks and streets, throwing tents, blankets, clothing and refuse that had been left behind into the trucks.
 The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in the United States District Court in Hawaii, charging that Honolulu was violating the constitutional rights of people struggling to survive. “We are very concerned about laws that criminalize the status of indigency,” said Daniel M. Gluck, the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Hawaii. “We have seen some very aggressive laws here.”
 The court agreed. In January, Honolulu signed a stipulation promising to wait 45 days before destroying the belongings it seized, allowing people a chance to retrieve them, and to guarantee 24 hours’ notice, in most cases, before clearing sidewalks and parks. The city is required to videotape the material it takes. “We have to store property longer, which we are doing,” Mr. Caldwell said. “We have to inventory what we store.” The sweeps have gone on: Eight-person crews go out five days a week.
 These kinds of cases, challenging city actions, are cropping up elsewhere. The United States Justice Department filed a brief last summer asking a federal court to throw out a Boise, Idaho, ordinance that prohibited sleeping in public places, arguing that anti-camping regulations in a city where there was insufficient shelter violated constitutional provisions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court dismissed the lawsuit brought by homeless plaintiffs.
 “It was a good opportunity for us to make very clear that jurisdictions like Boise can’t make it a crime for people who are homeless to sleep in public places when there aren’t enough beds in the city,” said Vanita Gupta, the principal deputy assistant general with the department’s civil rights division. “Punishing someone for sleeping in a public place would basically be punishing someone for being homeless. Criminalizing conduct that is integral to one’s status is equivalent to criminalizing status.”
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced this year that it would steer homeless assistance funds away from cities that use various prohibitions that it says make homelessness illegal. “We are strongly against such measures,” said Matthew Doherty, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates the federal response to homelessness. “By criminalizing people’s lives as they experience homelessness, it makes it harder to get them out of homelessness.”
 Ralph McCarroll sat slumped in a wheelchair on a busy Waikiki street corner, the morning sun bright over his head, his face tracked with stitches and bruises from tripping on the curb the night before. A pint of vodka was tucked at his side. Justin Phillips, who spent years living on the street and is now the senior outreach officer for the Institute for Human Services, a nonprofit agency which helps the homeless, crouched beside him.
 “Can I get you something?” Mr. Phillips asked, taking out a packet of baby wipes to clean the wounds on the man’s face.
 “Another bottle of vodka,” Mr. McCarroll said with a cackle.
 “I can’t do that for you,” Mr. Phillips said, leaning in to whisper another idea.
 “If I wanted detox, I would have been there already, Justin,” Mr. McCarroll replied.
 Mr. McCarroll has maintained his perch on his corner, law or no law, for as long as he can remember. Few authorities would want to be in a position of rousting a battered, 64-year-old man from his wheelchair. Not that they have given up. “I have 30 tickets,” he said. “I’m never going to pay them and they know that.”
 Yet that does not appear to deter Mr. Phillips, who is trying to persuade people whose plight he once shared to break out of this life. “We come out here, we try to get them into the shelter, cleaned up,” Mr. Phillips said. “At that point, we’ll try to do an intervention: ‘Hey, you want to go to detox? By the way, we have an outpatient program for alcohol and drugs. Can I sign you up?’ ”
 While punitive laws have drawn criticism from federal officials, they are applauded here by some advocates of the homeless. “A lot of people say these laws don’t work,” said Kimo Carvalho, the director of community relations with the Institute for Human Services. “But as a service provider, we advocated for these laws because our homeless outreach teams need to motivate clients to take action.”
 Two years ago, the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association gave $500,000 to the Institute for Human Services on a promise from the institute that it could cut the homeless population in Waikiki in half. The money went to pay for teams like the one Mr. Phillips was leading, a shuttle to take people to a shelter for a shower, clean clothes and food, and the airline relocation program. “This is our economic engine. We absolutely had to do this,” said Mr. Szigeti, the head of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, who was the president of the lodging and tourism association at the time.
 There were 559 men and women living on the streets of Waikiki and Chinatown when the program began in November 2014. As of early March, that population had been slashed by 392, Mr. Carvalho said: 219 had been placed in temporary or permanent housing, and another 173 had been flown out.
 Still, enforcement is a fraught subject in Hawaii, whose allure is built in no small part on marketing itself to the world as the Aloha State, with a welcoming atmosphere. Mr. Caldwell recoils at the use of words like “sweep” and “confiscation.” Leland Cadoy, a police corporal walking the streets of Waikiki with a reporter, kindly addressed every homeless person he saw, and spoke only of “R.C.P.s.”
 “Residentially challenged people,” he said, when asked about the acronym. “You call someone homeless, it sounds derogatory.”
 Even as he applauded the changes in Waikiki, David Ige, the governor, said the crackdown was not the answer to the homeless crisis that has become such a part of life here. He said that what Honolulu needed was affordable housing, a goal that has stubbornly eluded this island.
 “Homelessness has reached every community in the island — in areas where you didn’t see them five years ago,” he said. “If you are just enforcing and moving people from location to location you are not really reducing or solving the problem. It’s just making it someone else’s problems. It’s not like they can leave the state.”

"Nicklas Backstrom scored, Braden Holtby had 26 saves, and the Washington Capitals beat the Philadelphia Flyers, 1-0, on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals with a win on the road in Game 6.
 The Capitals will play the Pittsburgh Penguins, setting up a marquee matchup of Alex Ovechkin against Sidney Crosby.
 Ovechkin had an assist on Backstrom’s second-period goal, which was easily enough against the punchless Flyers.
 Michal Neuvirth was again sensational in goal, but the Flyers could not cash in against Holtby, wasting nearly two minutes of a 5-on-3 power play in the second period.
 “We sacrificed our body, 5 on 3,” Ovechkin said. “We paid the price, and we won.”
 The reward: keeping alive the pursuit of the first Stanley Cup title in franchise history.
 “It’s a different group,” Holtby said. “The past is a different regime. We are trying to write our own history.”
 Holtby, who had a 19-save shutout in Game 1, was barely tested the last two games. Most of their shots Sunday were from long range, and the Flyers never really attacked Holtby.
 Backstrom broke Neuvirth’s shutout streak, which stretched nearly 110 minutes, when he scored on a one-timer just below the circle with 8 minutes 59 seconds left in the second period.
 STARS 5, WILD 4 Jason Spezza scored his fourth goal of the series and added three assists, and Dallas needed every last one of them to hold off Minnesota in St. Paul, Minn., to win the first-round series, four games to two.
 Jared Spurgeon scored two of Minnesota’s four third-period goals, both on power plays, and the Wild came within a fraction of an inch of tying the game with 34 seconds remaining when Nino Niederreiter whacked at a loose puck in the crease.
 Freeze-frame replays showed it in the net but not quite fully across the goal line as it connected with goalie Kari Lehtonen’s right pad, a close call that was upheld on review.
 John Klingberg, Patrick Sharp, Jamie Benn and Alex Goligoski also scored for the Stars.
 With 24 seconds remaining in a sleepy second period, Benn put the Stars in front, 4-0, with his top-shelf shot. But the Wild were not ready to pack it in, as they proved during 20 torrid minutes.
 The Stars advanced in the playoffs for the first time since 2008, moving on to face the winner of the Chicago-St. Louis series, which will go to Game 7 on Monday night.
 LECAVALIER ENDS CAREER Los Angeles Kings center Vincent Lecavalier, who led the Tampa Bay Lightning to a Stanley Cup championship in 2004, announced that he was retiring.
 Lecavalier, 36, accrued 949 career points in 17 seasons and was the league’s top goal scorer in 2007, with 52 goals in 82 games. He was drafted first over all by the Lightning in 1998.

"WASHINGTON — President Obama will use the power of his office to try to jump-start long-stalled “smart-gun” technology that could eventually allow only the owner of a firearm to use it, the White House announced Friday.
 Over the opposition of gun rights groups, he also vowed to push ahead with a new federal policy giving the F.B.I. access to more mental health records of some Social Security recipients to better flag people who might be banned from buying a gun.
 The dual moves expand on a series of steps that a tearful Mr. Obama pledged to take in January to confront gun violence with or without Congress, which has offered stiff opposition to broader gun control measures.
 But the steps announced Friday generated objections not only from usual opponents like the National Rifle Association, but also from some police groups, which raised safety concerns about officers’ using untested smart guns in real-life situations.
 The administration stopped short of mandating the use of smart guns by federal agencies but said it saw promise in committing more federal money and attention to a technology that has evolved in fits and starts over more than two decades.
 The idea behind the smart-gun technology is to limit the use of a firearm to its owner, through personalized identifiers like a biometric sensor on the gun grip, a ring sensor worn by the owner or a digital pass code entered on a wristband.
 Advocates see the technology as a way of stopping criminals from using stolen guns — or children from accidentally shooting themselves or others. Just this month, the nation saw nine accidental shootings in one week involving children as young as 2 years old.
 But despite millions of dollars in federal grant money awarded to gun manufacturers and researchers, no commercially viable smart gun has emerged, officials said.
 In New Jersey, lawmakers passed a 2002 law requiring that guns be “smart” once they have been available on the market for three years. That three-year countdown has never been started in part because of pressure from gun rights activists on manufacturers not to develop the technology. Earlier this year, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a new smart-gun measure.
 The latest push was introduced on the White House website Friday, along with a report from the administration’s law enforcement agencies on the viability and effectiveness of smart-gun technology. It concluded that the federal government could do more — by making it cheaper for gun manufacturers to bring smart guns to the market and by using the federal government’s enormous purchasing power to encourage development.
 To that end, the Justice and Homeland Security Departments will develop criteria for gun manufacturers that want to sell smart guns to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
 The administration will also offer millions more in cash awards and grants to gun manufacturers to encourage development of the technology.
 In a post on his Facebook page, Mr. Obama wrote that “as long as we’ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun.”
 James O. Pasco Jr., executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, which has more than 330,000 members, said in a telephone interview that he was glad to see that the plan announced by the White House did not mandate the testing of smart-gun technology by law enforcement agencies.
 But he said he remained concerned by a renewed push.
 “They’ve been talking about smart guns for 25 years,” he said. “But we don’t want unproven technology to be tried out on law enforcement officers, who are most likely to be in the line of fire when they need their weapons to work. This is fine if the concept works, but we don’t want people going helter-skelter to embrace the latest shiny object.”
 The Obama administration also posted online Friday a proposed regulation from the Social Security Administration that officials believe could help keep guns out of the hands of people who are not allowed to own a firearm because of mental illness.
 A summary of the draft proposal said the Social Security Administration would identify people who receive disability payments because of mental impairment or because they are not competent to handle their own affairs, and would provide information on them to the Justice Department four times a year to include in the F.B.I.’s gun-purchase review system. The Social Security Administration would also notify those people — thought to total about 75,000 — that they are banned from buying or possessing a firearm under federal law.
 Advocates for the mentally ill say that those with mental illnesses would be unfairly stigmatized even though they account for only about 4 percent of all incidents of gun violence.
 The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, said that both the Social Security plan and the push for smart-gun technology were unwarranted “distractions” by an administration intent on imposing more restrictions on gun ownership.
 “President Obama’s obsession with gun control knows no bounds,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.’s lobbying arm.
 Mr. Obama signaled that he would take steps on the smart-gun technology and firearms purchases by Social Security recipients in January, when he announced a series of executive actions that also expanded background checks for some gun purchases and improved the tracking of stolen weapons.
 The president said he was forced to act on his own authority out of frustration after Congress stymied him in trying to enact broader gun control measures. In 2013, he failed to convince Congress to pass a universal background check requirement even after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, and other mass shootings.

"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s board approved a new version of its long-delayed capital plan on Wednesday, allocating money for system upgrades and expansion projects and restoring funding for the next phase of the Second Avenue subway line.
 The $29.5 billion spending plan calls for hundreds of new train cars and buses and a new fare-payment system to replace the MetroCard. With ridership booming on New York City’s aging subway system, the authority also devoted funding for station improvements and updated signal systems to allow more trains to operate.
 The agency promised $1 billion for plans to extend the Second Avenue subway to East Harlem — about $500 million more than an earlier proposal set aside. About $2.5 billion would be devoted to the East Side Access project, which would connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.
 Thomas F. Prendergast, the authority’s chairman, said he was confident that a state review board would approve the revised proposal in the next month. The capital plan will modernize the region’s vast transportation network and make sure that it is safe and reliable, he said.
 “This is a monumental win for the people of New York,” Mr. Prendergast said at a board meeting in Lower Manhattan.
 But even as board members praised the proposal, they questioned how the state and city would pay their share. Last year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, reached a funding deal only after months of quarreling over whether the city should pay more.
 The state agreed to pay $8.3 billion toward the capital plan over five years, and the city agreed to pay $2.5 billion over the same period. The rest is expected to be paid for by the federal government and other sources.
 State and city officials have not specified where most of their funding will come from. Transit advocates have repeatedly criticized Mr. Cuomo, arguing that his commitment amounted to an I.O.U. for the state-run agency.
 On Wednesday, Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and a former top aide to the governor, urged the board not to question Mr. Cuomo’s promise.
 “The money will be there,” Mr. Schwartz said.
 The plan had been delayed in recent months by budget negotiations in Albany, with Republicans in the State Senate pushing for extra money for roads and bridges and other legislators opposing cuts for the Second Avenue subway.
 The first phase of the Second Avenue project, which will extend the Q line to 96th Street, is scheduled to begin service at the end of the year. The second phase will expand the line to 125th Street.
 When the authority cut the project’s funding last year, incensed leaders in East Harlem claimed their community was being neglected. Robert J. Rodriguez, a state assemblyman, said Wednesday he was pleased that some funding was restored and that more was pledged for the next five-year capital plan.
 “We’ve gotten to a place where we’re happy that we’ll be able to substantially begin the work on Phase 2,” Mr. Rodriguez, a Democrat, said.
 The authority said it would apply for a federal grant program, New Starts, to pay for the additional $500 million for the project.
 As part of the budget agreement, the authority’s debt limit was raised to $55 billion from $41 billion, spurring concerns that the agency would take on debt to pay the state’s funding share. Robert E. Foran, the authority’s chief financial officer, told board members on Wednesday that if the agency financed debt on the state’s behalf, the state would pay for the debt service. The move would not prompt a fare increase, he said.
 The plan must be approved by the state’s Capital Program Review Board, which includes representatives of the governor, the mayor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority leader. The review board’s blessing would end a period of uncertainty at the authority, which first introduced the spending proposal more than a year and a half ago.
 Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, complained that the process took too long and that the governor’s funding plan was not concrete enough.
 “It’s a good thing for the riding public that it’s moving ahead,” he said, “but they didn’t set any indoor speed records.”

"Prepared foods are an increasingly important part of the grocery business, delivering fat margins at a time when sales of traditional packaged foods are lackluster. But the strategy also comes with serious risks.
 In the clearest example yet, the Food and Drug Administration this month sent a stern warning letter to Whole Foods Market, a longtime champion of fresh and healthy foods, saying that the company had failed to address a long list of food safety issues at its food processing plant outside of Boston.
 Among the problems cited: condensation dripping from the ceiling near food; an ammonium-based sanitizer used on a work surface near the preparation of a salad; and a failure to separate dirty dishes from ready-to-eat-salads.
 The letter from the F.D.A. is just the latest headache to afflict Whole Foods. Over the last couple of years, the company has struggled with slower growth as competitors have gotten better at copying what it did to distinguish itself in the grocery market. Other wounds have been self-inflicted, like last year, when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs called it out for mispricing some merchandise based on weight.
 Prepared foods, which have almost double the profit margins of packaged foods sold on grocery shelves, have remained a bright spot at the company — at least for now. Such foods accounted for almost 20 percent of its sales in 2014, ringing up $2.7 billion in revenue.
 But the letter from the F.D.A. is the second black eye for health issues at the plant outside of Boston, known as its North Atlantic Kitchen, and could put some of those sales in peril.
 Phil Lempert, an expert on grocery store operations and marketing, said that the food safety crisis at Chipotle Mexican Grill late last year should have been a wake-up call for Whole Foods and anyone else in the business of preparing fresh foods for sale.
 “For Whole Foods to be in this predicament, frankly, there really is no excuse,” Mr. Lempert said. “Because Wall Street has put it under such pressure to expand growth, I think Whole Foods has gotten sloppy — there’s no reason anyone should have water dripping into foods.”
 Last fall, Whole Foods voluntarily recalled batches of Curry Chicken Salad and Classic Deli Pasta Salad after a sample prepared at the North Atlantic Kitchen tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogenic strain of the bacterium. The plant is one of three preparation kitchens that help stock its stores in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and South. (Most of the company’s foods are prepared at the stores themselves.)
 In February, the inspectors spent five days at the plant and then shared their findings with Whole Foods, which responded within 15 business days. The company told the F.D.A. that it had retrained employees to address most of the issues the agency raised.
 That response, however, failed to satisfy the F.D.A. “We do not consider your response acceptable because you failed to provide documentation for our review, which demonstrates that all your noted corrective actions have been effectively implemented,” the agency wrote in its June 8 warning letter.
 Whole Foods said the letter came as a surprise. The company said it had taken steps to correct the problems and would meet on Thursday with the F.D.A. to discuss what the issues are and how to address them.
 “What’s confusing to us is the fact that the letter identifies issues we’ve already corrected,” said Ken Meyer, the company’s executive vice president for operations.
 “We worked with a third-party consultant and our own global food safety team,” he said, “to address their concerns and assumed we were in good standing with them until this letter arrived on Friday.”
 Whole Foods now has about two weeks to provide evidence to the F.D.A. that steps it has taken bring the company into compliance. Otherwise, the company might have to pay the agency to reinspect the facility.
 Groceries have long offered prepared foods like rotisserie chickens and broccoli salad. But as business has declined in the center store, companies have upped their game, adding sophisticated meals that consumers can take home or eat in the store.
 Research this year from the Food Marketing Institute and Technomic found that sales of prepared foods in groceries increased 10.4 percent from 2006 to 2014, making the prepared foods department one of the highest performers in the food business.
 While only 8 percent of the supermarkets responding to that survey reported sales growth of more than 5 percent, more than two-thirds of them said they had growth at that level or higher in their prepared food businesses.
 The risk for grocery companies is that preparing food receives a higher level of scrutiny from regulators than selling food made and packaged by others. A bad inspection in one location, or reports of food illnesses, can damage an entire brand. Shares in Whole Foods fell nearly 5 percent on Wednesday.
 Last year, Costco recalled celery sticks and turkey dinners, King Sooper recalled curried chicken salad and Raley’s recalled its Asian Blue Cheese, Potato and Bacon salad after E. coli was found in celery supplied to all by a single supplier.
 Still, perhaps no company has been more aggressive about integrating prepared foods than Whole Foods. The company has long put bars and restaurants into its stores — a new store in Hawaii will have about 200 seats for shoppers to sit and enjoy a meal and a drink.
 “Whole Foods is one of the pioneers in providing restaurant quality meals to consumers,” said Joe Pawlak, managing principal at Technomic.
 Now, stores like ShopRite and Safeway are opening so-called groceraunts, too. The oyster bar at one of the Mariano’s groceries in Chicago has become a place for a Friday night date, and a ShopRite in Morris Plains, N.J., added a 4,000-square-foot atrium where people can enjoy a meal.
 Supermarkets tried moving into the food preparation business in the 1990s, Mr. Pawlak said, but offered too broad a menu and ended up throwing a lot of food away.
 “Now what’s happened over the last five or six years, they’ve hired food service professionals who understand restaurants and how items move on a menu,” he said. “That’s taken the quality up to where I can get just as good a meal at the grocery store as I can in many sit-down restaurants — and for a lot better value.”
 An F.D.A. spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on whether its inspection of grocery food preparation operations was increasing. A Yahoo News analysis of the F.D.A.’s food safety recalls in 2015 found that prepared foods accounted for more recalls than any other food category.

"LOS ANGELES — Disney theme parks have always been about trading an imperfect world for a perfect one. There is no trash blowing down Main Street, U.S.A. It’s nothing but happy trappers and singing bears over in Frontierland. Dream big, and the gleaming technology of Tomorrowland just might come true.
 In case the castles are too subtle, Disney outright promises escape from the real world. The welcome signs at Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida quote Walt Disney’s words from 1955, “Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy.”
 Lately, however, it has become harder for Americans planning a Disney vacation to buy into the company’s utopian theme park concept. The horrific mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., cast a shadow on nearby tourist destinations, including Disney World. Then word leaked that the gunman had also scoped out a Disney shopping complex. Next came an incident that was shocking enough to kick the nightclub carnage off some front pages: A toddler was dragged by an alligator into a Disney World lake and drowned.
 “Is Disney’s Image Tarnished?” a headline on an investment website asked on Monday, with the alligator attack — the first such accident in Disney’s 45-year history in Florida — as a particular source of concern. The funeral for Lane Graves, the 2-year-old victim, was held Tuesday in Nebraska.
 Whether last week’s events reverberate for Disney in a business sense (beyond a possible lawsuit stemming from the alligator attack) is a question that will only be fully answered in the months to come, peak season for theme park vacations. If families cancel reservations or the pace of reservations noticeably slows, then the answer is yes. If they do not — as most analysts predict — then Disney will power forward, recovering from this spate of bad publicity as it has from others.
 The company’s stock price is already improving, climbing about 3 percent since Thursday, when authorities discovered Lane Graves’s body. Blockbuster results for “Finding Dory” at the box office helped, as did the opening of Shanghai Disneyland.
 Theme parks, zoos and other tourist destinations have survived tragedies before. One-time incidents tend not to undermine well-run businesses, and Disney parks are definitely thriving.
 But even without recent events, Disney was having to work harder to pull off its “not a worry in the world” magic trick. Record crowds have made the experience less joyful. So has technology: Never mind their cynical parents, American children, babysat by iPad from the time they were in diapers, are not as easily mesmerized by analog rides like It’s a Small World and Autopia, with its little cars putt-putting along a track.
 More aggressive safety procedures have become a fixture of modern life; metal detectors are now routine at baseball stadiums, concert arenas and even some movie theaters. In response to increased security concerns, Disney, Universal and SeaWorld began using metal detectors in December, the first time the companies deployed such measures on a large scale.
 But these measures, while appreciated by most tourists who might feel less safe without them, work against Disney’s singular efforts to create what it advertises as “the Happiest Place on Earth.” It’s awfully hard to forget the real world when you’re being wanded.
 Shanghai Disneyland, formally unveiled on Thursday, also has rows of metal detectors at its graceful front gates. But the mood at this newest Disney park — the first on the Chinese mainland — was utterly joyful last week, even as the grim news from Orlando made its way to visitors’ smartphones. Spending time in the park on four different days, three of them with paying guests, I was struck by how fully intact that classic Disney sense of wonder really seemed.
 Without question, the excitement and pomp around the opening contributed to that feeling. But something else was happening at Shanghai Disneyland. I got the sense that this was what it must have felt like at the original Disneyland in the 1950s. Visitors were very obviously awe-struck — this fantastical place, smelling of fresh paint and new vinyl seat covers, was something they had never seen before. Chinese guests, having never confronted a 9/11 or repeated mass shootings, seemed free of the baggage that many Americans now carry to public gathering places. The spell seemed easier for Disney to cast.
 Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, alluded to this fascination as we toured Shanghai Disneyland on June 11. “I grew up in the United States dreaming of going to Disneyland one day — unaffordable for us, by the way, and I didn’t go until I was a parent,” he said. “You now have that same dynamic here in China that existed in the ’50s and ’60s in the United States, as people started looking for more leisure activities. It’s palpable.”
 In Shanghai, Disney’s rides are fully updated technological marvels — no more jerky animatronics in Pirates of the Caribbean, which is now fully digital, with boats controlled by underwater magnets and Imax-style screens with video. In another difference from Disney’s domestic parks, even rank-and-file cashiers and hotel maids seem thrilled to be there. When they waved and chirped, “Have a magical day!” they appeared to mean it, rather than just repeating a corporate mantra.
 On an especially difficult week for Disney in the United States, Shanghai proved that the company’s pixie dust still works the same way it used to in a more innocent age. Even if you have to go to the other side of the world to find it.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Islamic State militants have abducted about 900 Kurdish civilians in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo over the past three weeks, amid fierce fighting for control of a nearby militant stronghold, a Kurdish official and Syrian activists said Friday.
 The abductions began shortly after the Syria Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-dominated coalition of Syrians fighting the Islamic State and backed by the United States, began an offensive on May 31 to capture the town of Manbij from the militants.
 The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 900 Kurdish civilians had been detained near Al Bab, a town held by the Islamic State.
 A spokesman for the Syrian Defense Forces, Sherfan Darwish, told The Associated Press that the abductions were in retaliation for the offensive on Manbij. “Whenever Daesh is defeated, they retaliate against civilians,” Mr. Darwish said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL. He said whole families were among those abducted.
 The Observatory and Mr. Darwish said that some of those taken captive had been forced to dig trenches in Islamic State-held areas, while others were imprisoned in detention centers. Mr. Darwish said that all captured men and boys older than 12 were sent against their will to the front lines to help fortify the militants’ positions.
 The Observatory said Islamic State fighters had stormed homes in several villages they control near Al Bab, including Arab, Qabaseen and Nairabiyeh, and took with them mostly men.
 In 2014, fighters abducted nearly 200 Kurdish students near Manbij as they were traveling from the Kurdish border town of Kobani to Aleppo, the provincial capital, to take their exams. Most were released.
 In February 2015, the group kidnapped more than 200 Christians from northeastern Syria. The Christians were released over a period of a year, after the Islamic State collected millions of dollars in ransom.
 Opposition activists reported clashes inside Manbij on Friday and airstrikes by a United States-led coalition.
 Since the offensive to take Manbij began last month, Kurdish fighters and their allies have captured dozens of villages and farms near the town, which Kurdish officials said was now surrounded from all sides.
 The battle for Manbij has so far claimed the lives of 81 Syrian Defense Force fighters and 463 Islamic State fighters, according to the Observatory.

"A group of young black women poised to graduate from the United States Military Academy gathered on the steps of West Point’s oldest barracks last week in traditional gray dress uniforms, complete with sabers, for a group photo. Known as an “Old Corps” photograph because it mimics historical portraits, it was nearly identical to thousands that cadets have posed for over the decades, with one key difference: The 16 women raised their clenched fists.
 The gesture, posted on Facebook and Twitter last week, touched off a barrage of criticism in and out of the armed forces as some commenters accused the women of allying themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement and sowing racial divisions in a military that relies on assimilation.
 West Point opened an investigation on April 28 into whether the women violated Army rules that prohibit political activities while in uniform. Now, as the women wait to hear if they will be punished, they are gaining supporters who say they were simply making a gesture of solidarity and strength.
 The elite public military academy, which trains many of the Army’s future leaders, is overwhelmingly male and 70 percent white. The 16 cadets in the photo represented all but one of the black women in a graduating class of about 1,000, a meager 1.7 percent. But the Army has long tried to play down race and gender to create a force where “everyone is green.”
 When it comes to protest, West Point could not be more different from a civilian campus, where demonstrations, sit-ins and leaflets are commonplace.
 At the military academy, in contrast, public displays of politics by students and staff members are prohibited in an effort to build a unified force that remains clear of partisanship.
 The group photo has revealed an underlying tension at West Point.
 The academy, while seeking to foster a diverse student body that reflects the nation, also aims to educate future officers in the regimented ways of the military, in which the only differences that matter are the ranks displayed on soldiers’ shoulders.
 At the heart of the controversy is the gesture the women chose: Did it represent a divisive political statement, a matter of free speech, or just a case of students showing their sense of accomplishment as graduation, set for May 21, drew near?
 John Burk, an Iraq veteran turned blogger who lives in Georgia, said he was sent the photo by a concerned person at West Point. On Tuesday, he wrote a post saying that by raising their fists, the women were identified with Black Lives Matter activists “known for inflicting violent protest throughout various parts of the United States, calling for the deaths of police officers, and even going so far as to call for the deaths of white Americans.”
 Mr. Burk, a former drill sergeant, who is white, said via email that he had disciplined soldiers for making Nazi salutes in photos, and felt the raised fist was not much different. “The fact that it could offend someone by its usage qualifies it as a symbol that goes against Army policies,” he said, adding, “It’s not the fact that they are wrong for having their beliefs, it’s the fact they did it while in uniform.”
 But others who have spoken with the cadets said that evoking Black Lives Matter was not their intention, and that the raised fist that was once a sign of militant uprising is now often a pop culture symbol of strength and pride that has been hoisted in such mundane settings as this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.
 “These ladies weren’t raising their fist to say Black Panthers. They were raising it to say Beyoncé,” said Mary Tobin, a 2003 graduate of West Point and an Iraq veteran who is a mentor to some of the seniors and has talked with them about the photograph.
 “For them it’s not a sign of allegiance to a movement, it’s a sign that means unity and pride and sisterhood. That fist to them meant you and your sisters did what only a few people, male or female, have ever done in this country.”
 She said the women were dismayed by the controversy they had caused. She said most of the West Point graduates she had contacted in recent days saw the women’s gesture as a mistake and planned to lobby against punishment.
 Gestures of solidarity with Black Lives Matter, which seeks to bring attention to the killing of African-Americans by the police, are hardly uncommon among college students.
 Such protests have roiled many campuses, and a photograph distributed on social media of black football players at the University of Missouri linking arms and vowing to boycott a big game prompted a reshuffling of the university’s top leadership.
 There is a very different environment at West Point, where incoming students are stripped of all personal possessions, including watches and glasses, and remolded through weeks of grueling team building and history lessons into cadets.
 The academy permits an array of student groups, including a club for black cadets, known as the Contemporary Affairs Club, but activism is not a permitted activity.
 West Point officials declined to comment on what punishment, if any, the women might receive, saying an inquiry was continuing.
 This is not the first time students have made a political statements in an Old Corps photo. In 1976, the year before women were admitted to the academy, male cadets widely referred to themselves as “the last class with balls,” according to an officer who teaches at West Point. The officer, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak, said that a number of seniors that year posed for a photo holding armloads of basketballs, footballs and baseballs. They were not punished, the officer said.
 Among Black Lives Matter activists, the women’s gesture was viewed as a generic one that did not necessarily show solidarity with any political cause. Jonathan Pulphus, a junior at St. Louis University and an organizer for the movement, said raising the fist was a way for a younger generation of blacks to pay respect to civil rights accomplishments and create “a space for themselves in institutions where they tend to not have a sense of belonging.”
 He said a failure by West Point to recognize this could discourage black students from applying.
 “If you want to make an institution appeal to a certain kind of crowd,” he added, “you don’t stigmatize some of the more important cultural pieces to a student’s background.”

"Elton John and his longtime boyfriend, David Furnish, entered a civil partnership on Dec. 21, 2005, in England under a law the country had just enacted granting recognition to same-sex couples. The congratulations poured in as the two men appeared at a joyous ceremony at Windsor Guildhall, amid a crush of paparazzi. Donald J. Trump, who had known the couple for years, took to his blog to express his excitement.
 “I know both of them, and they get along wonderfully. It’s a marriage that’s going to work,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding: “I’m very happy for them. If two people dig each other, they dig each other.”
 Mr. Trump is now the leading candidate for president in the Republican primary, which has traditionally been dominated by hopefuls eager to show how deeply conservative they are on social issues like gay rights and marriage.
 But Mr. Trump is far more accepting of sexual minorities than his party’s leaders have been. On Thursday, he startled some Republicans by saying on NBC’s “Today” show that he opposed a recently passed North Carolina law that prohibits people from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to the gender they were born with, striking down a Charlotte ordinance.
 Transgender people should “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate,” Mr. Trump said, putting him at odds with a majority of Republicans in North Carolina.
 But it is his views on gay rights and gay people that most distinguish Mr. Trump from previous Republican standard-bearers. He has nurtured long friendships with gay people, employed gay workers in prominent positions, and moved with ease in industries where gays have long exerted influence, like entertainment.
 “He will be the most gay-friendly Republican nominee for president ever,” said Gregory T. Angelo, the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group that supports gay rights.
 Of course, Mr. Trump is not as embracing of gay rights as the Democratic candidates are; he said during this campaign that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman, a position he has held since at least 2000, when he briefly flirted with a bid for the presidency. But he does not emphasize marriage as an issue, and he makes no mention of it, for example, on his campaign website, which focuses on issues like immigration and trade.
 And Mr. Trump, who has inflamed tensions with almost every group, from Hispanics to women to African-Americans, has avoided attacking or offending gay men and lesbians during the campaign.
 His history with the gay community is a long one. He donated to charities focused on the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s and early ’90s. In 2000, when he briefly considered running for president, he gave an interview to The Advocate, a gay magazine, in which he supported amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to “include a ban of discrimination based on sexual orientation.”
 “It would be simple. It would be straightforward,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, adding, “It’s only fair.”
 Sixteen years later, gay rights advocates are still trying to persuade Congress to pass a similar measure, but they have struggled to win support, especially from Republicans. The last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, opposed similar legislation in 2012.
 Mr. Trump declined to be interviewed for this article.
 His ease with gay people does not seem to be the result of deep soul searching, but, rather, the product of the Manhattan social and political world he has inhabited the past five decades.
 “I live in New York. I know many, many gay people. Tremendous people,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in 2011.
 He has been playful at times, such as in 2000, when he and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared in a skit for a political roast, during which Mr. Trump nuzzled and caressed the mayor, who was dressed in drag.
 Friends say he also views gay rights through the lens of a bottom line-minded businessman.
 “His key concern is, Are you capable and able to do the job I hired you for? And if you are, very little else matters,” said Abe Wallach, an openly gay executive at the Trump Organization in the 1990s. “Very little on a social level will make Donald excited — if it was money or something else, he might get excited.”
 Mr. Trump was believed to be the first private club owner in Palm Beach, Fla., to admit an openly gay couple, according to Laurence Leamer, the author of “Madness Under the Royal Palms,” a book about Palm Beach society. Mr. Trump made his club, Mar-a-Lago, more open partly out of disdain for the restrictions that barred Jews and African-Americans from joining exclusive clubs in Palm Beach.
 “It’s one of the best things he’s done in my view in his life,” Mr. Leamer said. “He really changed the nature of Palm Beach.”
 Rand Hoch, a gay activist who founded the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council in 1988, recalled bringing dates to Mar-a-Lago on two occasions. Both times, he said, Mr. Trump, who loves to play the role of greeter as guests arrive at his club, was pleasant and approached the two for chitchat.
 “He treated us no differently than everyone else who was going through that door,” Mr. Hoch said, adding that it was not possible that Mr. Trump was unaware they were gay. “He’s perceptive, so I’m pretty sure he didn’t think we were brothers.”
 Mr. Wallach said that he and his husband would fly on Mr. Trump’s jet to Florida or Atlantic City on weekends. “I found him to be very friendly to my spouse,” he said. “He would often ask about my spouse, how his dental practice was doing.”
 Mr. Trump’s foundation has given over the years to groups like the AIDS Service Center and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Some of those donations came more recently in connection with his reality television show “The Celebrity Apprentice,” whose winners got to select the recipient charities. But as early as 1987, Mr. Trump made a $25,000 contribution to the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, from profits generated by his company’s operation of the Wollman Memorial Rink in Central Park. And in 1992, the Trump Taj Mahal held an event that raised $60,000 for AIDS research.
 Mr. Trump’s recent alliances with social conservatives such as Jerry Falwell Jr. and Pat Robertson have alarmed people like Mr. Angelo, whose group, the Log Cabin Republicans, is eager to meet with the real estate mogul to discuss his positions in detail.
 And some gay acquaintances of Mr. Trump find it puzzling that he cannot support same-sex marriage, given his comfort with gay relationships.
 In 2012, Mr. Trump attended the wedding of Jordan Roth, a Broadway producer, and Richie Jackson, in a ceremony at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.
 Months later, Mr. Trump went to lunch with the actor George Takei, who is openly gay and was fired by Mr. Trump from “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Mr. Takei approached Mr. Trump at a news conference for the show, saying he would like to try to change his views on letting gay people marry. “He said, ‘George, maybe I could learn something from you,’ ” Mr. Takei said in a telephone interview this week from his home in California.
 The lunch, at Trump Tower, opened with Mr. Trump mentioning the wedding he had attended, which Mr. Takei later learned was that of Mr. Roth and Mr. Jackson.
 Mr. Takei walked Mr. Trump through the benefits of supporting same-sex marriage, particularly for a business owner. Gay couples would celebrate in his hotels, and their guests would dine in his restaurants, Mr. Takei said. Mr. Trump agreed with that view, Mr. Takei said, but he would not budge, saying he supported “traditional marriage.”
 “I was tempted to say, marrying multiple times is not traditional marriage,” Mr. Takei said of Mr. Trump, who has been married three times.

"William F. Weld, the twice-elected former Republican governor of Massachusetts, who was last seen campaigning in the 2006 Republican primary for governor of New York, now hopes to be on a national ticket as the vice-presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party.
 And he is already on the attack.
 In his first interview since accepting an invitation to be the running mate of former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, Mr. Weld assailed Donald J. Trump over his call to round up and deport the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.
 “I can hear the glass crunching on Kristallnacht in the ghettos of Warsaw and Vienna when I hear that, honest,” Mr. Weld said Thursday.
 Mr. Weld, 70, was not uniformly critical of the presumptive Republican nominee. “I don’t consider myself part of the Never Trump movement,” he said, expressing admiration for Mr. Trump’s success in the primary contest.
 “I’m not horrified about everything Mr. Trump has done at all,” he said, adding: “I think he’s done a lot. But when I think about some of the positions, I think they’re way out there.”
 Where he differs with Mr. Trump most sharply is on Mr. Trump’s call for mass deportations.
 Asked if he believed Mr. Trump was a fascist, Mr. Weld demurred. “My Kristallnacht analogy does evoke the Nazi period in Germany,” he said. “And that’s what I’m worried about: a slippery slope.”
 After a circuitous answer, he eventually came to a conclusion. “No, I wouldn’t call Mr. Trump either a fascist or a Nazi,” Mr. Weld said. “I’m just saying, we got to watch it when we get exclusionary about people on account of their status as a member of a group.”
 Mr. Weld also objected to Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to impose tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and China. “That’s a pretty good prescription to having China be the only superpower in about 10 years,” he said, leaning forward to make sure a reporter understood him. “China — not the U.S.”
 Mr. Weld’s best known previous turn on the national stage was in 1997, when he resigned as governor to focus on his appointment by President Bill Clinton as ambassador to Mexico.
 That did not go well: He was blocked by Senator Jesse Helms and withdrew his nomination after a heated battle in which Mr. Weld, a pillar of what was left of the moderate northeastern Republican establishment, loudly assailed Mr. Helms and the archconservatives who stood behind him.
 A former prosecutor, Mr. Weld could appeal to some disaffected Republicans on a ticket alongside Mr. Johnson at a time when other efforts by Republicans to recruit a third-party candidate — in part in the hopes of keeping anti-Trump Republican voters from staying home and costing the party’s lower-tier candidates — are close to fizzling.
 Mr. Weld said Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate in 2012 who is seeking the party’s nomination again, spoke to him last weekend about running. Their hope is to amass enough support in national polls to be included in the presidential debates. If that happened, Mr. Weld said hopefully, it would not be impossible to envision a minor-party ticket winning the White House.
 But he also did not protest too much when asked how he would reassure those who, mindful of his willingness to roll the dice in politics, might question his level of commitment to a national run.
 “There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Weld, who now works at a law firm, Mintz Levin, and its lobbying arm, ML Strategies. “I do like to climb mountains in politics, and I do enjoy running for office.”
 The Libertarian Party says it already will be on the ballot in 32 states and is working on the rest. It will pick its presidential and vice-presidential nominees at a convention over Memorial Day weekend in Orlando, Fla.
 Mr. Weld suggested that the Libertarian message, which emphasizes civil liberties and small government, could appeal to younger voters.
 Discussing foreign policy, he spoke critically of the Iraq invasion of 2003 and of putting “boots on the ground” in the Middle East to project American strength. But he was supportive of the Obama administration on the Iran nuclear deal that Republicans frequently criticize.
 “I thought the game was worth the candle there, and that’s politically incorrect in almost all circles — certainly in Republican circles — but I think I do feel that way, and I followed that closely,” Mr. Weld said, adding, “I know John Kerry quite well and I saw his going back and forth, and rather admired it.” (Mr. Weld unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Kerry in the 1996 Senate race.)
 Asked about Hillary Clinton, Mr. Weld noted that he had known her since they were both in their 20s. “I’ve always just thought of her as a really great kid,” he said.
 Mr. Weld said he possessed a deep libertarian streak, and pined for a time when that was more widespread in the Republican Party. He complained about the polarization in Congress and remembered his early days working on Capitol Hill, before law school, for Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York.
 “It was a totally different era and a wonderful era,” he said. “It was wonderful to be in Washington in those days. And things absolutely got done.”

"WASHINGTON — Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia used his executive power on Friday to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons, circumventing the Republican-run legislature. The action effectively overturns a Civil War-era provision in the state’s Constitution aimed, he said, at disenfranchising African-Americans.
 The sweeping order, in a swing state that could play a role in deciding the November presidential election, will enable all felons who have served their prison time and finished parole or probation to register to vote. Nearly half are African-American, a core constituency of Democrats, Mr. McAuliffe’s political party.
 Amid intensifying national attention over harsh sentencing policies that have disproportionately affected African-Americans, governors and legislatures around the nation have been debating — and often fighting over — moves to restore voting rights for convicted felons. Virginia imposes especially harsh restrictions, barring felons from voting for life.
 In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a newly elected Republican, recently overturned an order enacted by his Democratic predecessor that was similar to the one Mr. McAuliffe signed Friday. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, vetoed a measure to restore voting rights to convicted felons, but Democrats in the state legislature overrode him in February and an estimated 44,000 former prisoners who are on probation can now register to vote.
 “There’s no question that we’ve had a horrible history in voting rights as relates to African-Americans — we should remedy it,” Mr. McAuliffe said in an interview Thursday, previewing the announcement he made on the steps of Virginia’s Capitol, just yards from where President Abraham Lincoln once addressed freed slaves. “We should do it as soon as we possibly can.”
 Republicans in the Virginia Legislature have resisted measures to expand voting rights for convicted felons, and Mr. McAuliffe’s action, which he said was justified under an expansive legal interpretation of his executive clemency authority, provoked an immediate backlash. Virginia Republicans issued a statement Friday accusing the governor of “political opportunism” and “a transparent effort to win votes.”
 “Those who have paid their debts to society should be allowed full participation in society,” said the statement from the party chairman, John Whitbeck. “But there are limits.” He said Mr. McAuliffe was wrong to issue a blanket restoration of rights, even to those who “committed heinous acts of violence.”
 The order includes those convicted of violent crimes, including murder and rape. There is no way to know how many of the newly eligible voters in Virginia will register. “My message is going to be that I have now done my part,” Mr. McAuliffe said.
 Nationally, an estimated 5.85 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions, according to The Sentencing Project, a Washington research organizations, which says one in five African-Americans in Virginia cannot vote.
 Only two states, Maine and Vermont, have no voting restrictions on felons; Virginia is among four – the others are Kentucky, Florida and Iowa – that have the harshest restrictions.
 Friday’s shift in Virginia is part of a national trend toward restoring voter rights to felons, based in part on the hope that it will aid former prisoners’ re-entry into society. Over the last two decades about 20 states have acted to ease their restrictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
 In Kentucky, Mr. Bevin, who took office in November, promptly overturned an executive order issued by his predecessor, Steven L. Beshear, just before he left office. Then, last week, Mr. Bevin signed into law a less expansive measure, allowing felons to petition judges to vacate their convictions, which would enable them to vote.
 Previous governors in Florida and Iowa took executive action to ease their lifetime bans, but in each case, a subsequent governor restored the tough rules.
 Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said Mr. McAuliffe’s decision would have lasting consequences because it will remain in effect at least until January 2018, when the governor leaves office.
 “This will be the single most significant action on disenfranchisement that we’ve ever seen from a governor,” Mr. Mauer said, “and it’s noteworthy that it’s coming in the middle of this term, not the day before he leaves office. So there may be some political heat but clearly he’s willing to take that on, which is quite admirable.”
 Myrna Pérez, director of a voting rights project at the Brennan Center, said Mr. McAuliffe’s move was particularly important because Virginia has had such restrictive laws on voting by felons. Still, she said,“Compared to the rest of the country, this is a very middle of the road policy.’’
 Ms. Pérez said a number of states already had less restrictive policies than the one announced by Mr. McAuliffe. Fourteen states allow felons to vote after their prison terms are completed even while they remain on parole or probation.
 Advocates who have been working with the Virginia governor say they are planning to fan out into Richmond communities Friday to start registering people.
 Experts say with the stroke of his pen, Mr. McAuliffe has allowed convicted felons to begin registering to vote, and that their voting rights cannot be revoked — even if a new governor rescinds the order for future released prisoners.
 But the move led to accusations that the governor was playing politics; he is a longtime friend of — and fund-raiser for — Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for president, and former President Bill Clinton.
 In the interview, Mr. McAuliffe said that he was not acting for political reasons, and that few people outside his immediate staff knew of his plan. He said he did not consult with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign before making the decision.
 The executive order builds on steps the governor had already taken to restore voting rights to 18,000 Virginians since the beginning of his term, and he said he believed his authority to issue the decision was “ironclad.”
 Prof. A. E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia School of Law, the principal draftsman of a revised Constitution adopted by Virginia in 1971, agreed, and said the governor had “ample authority.” But Professor Howard, who advised Mr. McAuliffe on the issue, said the move might well be challenged in court. The most likely argument, he said, is that the governor cannot restore voting rights to an entire class of people all at once.
 Virginia’s Constitution has prohibited felons from voting since the Civil War; the restrictions were expanded in 1902, as part of a package that included poll taxes and literacy tests.
 In researching the provisions, advisers to the governor turned up a 1906 report that quoted Carter Glass, a Virginia state senator, as saying they would “eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this State in less than five years, so that in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government.”
 Mr. McAuliffe, who took office in 2014 and campaigned to restore voting rights to felons, said that he viewed disenfranchisement as “a remnant of the poll tax” and that he had been “trying to figure out what more I can possibly do.”
 The governor’s action Friday will not apply to felons released in the future; his aides say Mr. McAuliffe intends to issue similar orders on a monthly basis to cover people as they are released.
 “People have served their time and done their probation,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “I want you back in society. I want you feeling good about yourself. I want you voting, getting a job, paying taxes.’’

"OAKLAND, Calif. — When Athletics catcher Stephen Vogt hit a tailing liner down the left-field line that bounced toward the wall for a double on Sunday afternoon, Yankees starter Michael Pineda followed the drill and ran to back up catcher Brian McCann.
 As Jake Smolinski crossed the plate and Billy Burns followed him, giving Oakland the lead in the fifth inning, Pineda hopped up and down several times. While walking back to the mound, he shook his head and waved his hand in disgust.
 The frustration was understandable, given how well Pineda had pitched to that point.
 But unlike much of this season, one mistake — or even two — did not leave Pineda with a day’s regret.
 The Yankees rallied to regain the lead on sixth-inning singles by Mark Teixeira and Starlin Castro, then hung on for a 5-4 victory over the Athletics at Oakland Coliseum.
 The win, which completed a four-game sweep of Oakland, was the Yankees’ season-high fifth in a row and the 12th in their last 17 games, allowing them a chance to enjoy their day off on Monday — the only break in a stretch of 40 games.
 The turnaround comes at a good time: The Yankees play 12 of their next 13 games against division teams.
 “It’s a lot better,” Manager Joe Girardi said of the team’s mood after the Yankees began the season losing 16 of 24 games. “There was a lot of frustration in our clubhouse, whether it was from pitchers or whether it was from position players who were struggling with the bat. Everyone seems to be doing their part now.”
 The Yankees’ about-face mirrors a more recent one by their starting pitchers. It was only on Tuesday, after losses in back-to-back games in Arizona to begin this trip, that the rotation looked tattered: C. C. Sabathia and Luis Severino were on the disabled list, Masahiro Tanaka was in a funk, and Pineda was a mess.
 Pineda’s habit of hanging sliders — slightly spinning cookies that sat invitingly in the middle of the plate when he had two strikes on hitters — had confounded the pitching coach, Larry Rothschild. In Arizona last week, Rothschild’s even temperament gave way to exasperation after Pineda struck out nine but also gave up five runs and made two fielding blunders in five innings.
 “It would be easy to sit here and say it’s going to turn and things will change, but it’s too long,” Rothschild said on Tuesday. “We’re almost a quarter of the way through his starts, so we need that straightened out.”
 Rothschild was modestly encouraged on Sunday after Pineda allowed six hits, struck out six and walked one in six innings. Pineda had stayed more upright and kept his shoulder and elbow elevated, resolving problems that had led to his inconsistency.
 “He made some strides today — he just needs to keep making more strides,” Rothschild said, citing Pineda’s consistency with his fastball and slider, the latter of which still needs to be better.
 Pineda, who improved to 2-5 and lowered his E.R.A. to 6.34, had himself to blame in the first inning, when Burns singled, stole second and then third when Pineda — as he had with Arizona’s Paul Goldschmidt last week — never looked back at Burns as he took a huge, walking lead off second. Burns scored on a groundout by Vogt.
 The Yankees regained the lead, 2-1, on homers by McCann and Jacoby Ellsbury, and Pineda had the misfortune of losing it in the fifth. Smolinski reached down to pull a slider into left for a one-out single, and with two out, Burns bounced a chopper over the head of third baseman Chase Headley, who had been drawn in. Vogt followed by slicing a 95-mile-per-hour fastball that was on the outside edge, scoring both runners.
 Pineda’s performance was heartening, although it was the worst performance by a starter during the win streak. Nathan Eovaldi, Ivan Nova, Sabathia and Tanaka each pitched at least six innings and gave up a lone run.
 Rothschild was baffled by how a rotation that does so well in critical statistical categories — fewest walks in the American League, fourth in strikeouts per nine innings and first in groundball-to-fly ball ratio — had a 4.71 E.R.A., 11th best in the league, entering Sunday.
 “Some numbers are just hard to comprehend,” he said. “None of it makes any sense to me.”
 Equally baffling has been the slide of Teixeira, who has not homered in 120 at-bats, the worst stretch of his career. Teixeira had a small and significant victory on Sunday: He reached on a grounder when second baseman Chris Coghlan — playing in short right field — could not throw him out. It ended an 0-for-19 slump and brought Brett Gardner sliding headfirst into home with the tying run.
 “You just make sure you’re running hard, because you don’t know what’s happening behind you,” said Gardner, who began the play at second and kept running when he heard the third-base coach, Joe Espada, shouting, “Go hard, go hard, go hard.”
 Castro followed with a single that scored Carlos Beltran, who added a run-scoring double in the seventh.
 That run proved important when shortstop Didi Gregorius and Castro booted consecutive grounders in the eighth that allowed the A’s to close to 5-4.
 When the Yankees return to Yankee Stadium, they expect that Alex Rodriguez, out since May 4 with a strained hamstring, will be in the lineup, although Girardi would not say if Rodriguez would be slotted into his usual No. 3 spot.
 “Can you worry about today?” Girardi said. “We don’t even know if we’ll be here on Tuesday.”
 That may be true, but with the way the Yankees have begun to play, and with their starting pitchers rounding into form, it no longer seems as if their world is coming to an end.

"LONDON — More than seven decades after World War II ended, unexploded munitions remain a hazard in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
 In the latest such scare in Britain, hundreds of people in the historic and picturesque town of Bath were evacuated from their homes on Thursday afternoon after contractors discovered, under a former school playground, a 500-pound bomb believed to date from World War II. Some spent the night at a local racetrack.
 On Friday, the authorities set up a 1,000-foot perimeter around the site of the bomb, the former Royal High Junior School in Bath, and closed a vast network of roads around it. They planned to place about 275 tons of sand around it, and then take it to a remote location, “where they will carry out a controlled explosion.”
 Not everyone inside the evacuation zone was ordered to leave; some chose to remain, but were advised to “move to a safe distance” from the playground.
 “Those who have remained inside the exclusion zone will be prevented from moving within 100 meters of the device for their own safety,” the local police agency, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, said in a statement. “We recognize the disruption this incident has already caused to residents inside the exclusion zone and we’d like to thank them for their patience.
 “Decisions to evacuate houses are never taken lightly but during these incidents public safety will always be our primary concern,” Chief Inspector Kevin Thatcher said in a statement. “We also appreciate the anxiety many in the local community may feel following the discovery device and the time required to remove it but we would urge people not to be alarmed.”
 Bath, in southwest England, is a popular tourist destination, known since Roman times for its natural hot springs, and since the 18th century for its gracious Georgian architecture.
 In 1942, the Luftwaffe bombed the city. A report from that time describes “wrecked churches and buildings”; “old women, limping and with freshly bandaged heads,” the “smell of compounded brick dust” and the “rank odor of wet charred wood.”
 Even today, bombs from the war are found, often by workers digging at construction sites.
 In August 2015, 150 people were evacuated after a 500-pound unexploded World War II bomb was found in the basement of a building site in Bethnal Green, in East London. In November of that year, another bomb from that era caused a scare at Spitalfields, a popular market, also in East London.
 The danger posed by the bombs is taken very seriously because they still contain explosives, which can prove lethal. That has been a particular concern in Germany, which was heavily bombed by Allied forces during the war.
 In 2013, as many as 20,000 people in Dortmund were evacuated so that specialists could neutralize a powerful “blockbuster” bomb, which, according to a report in Smithsonian Magazine, was powerful enough to destroy parts of a city block.
 In 2014, a buried World War II bomb exploded at a construction site in Euskirchen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, killing an excavator driver and injuring eight other people.

"This year is off to a record-breaking start for global temperatures.
 It has been the hottest year to date, with January, February and March each passing marks set in 2015, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
 March was also the 11th consecutive month to set a record high for temperatures, which agencies started tracking in the 1800s.
 With the release on Tuesday of its global climate report, NOAA is the third independent agency — along with NASA and the Japan Meteorological Association — to reach similar findings, each using slightly different methods.
 The reports add a sense of urgency at the United Nations, where world diplomats are gathered this week to sign the climate accord reached late last year in Paris, when 195 nations committed to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
 Since the initial agreement was reached, other global anomalies have been reported that punctuate the threat of climate change, including troubling trends on Arctic sea ice, floods, drought and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.
 Some of these — warm temperatures and heavy rains in particular — can be explained in part by this year’s El Niño phenomenon, which scientists predicted would release large amounts of heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere, causing irregular weather patterns across the globe.
 But the effects of the current El Niño have been exacerbated by global warming, a result of emissions of greenhouse gases by humans, said Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with NOAA and lead author of the report.
 El Niño is on its way out, and ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific peaked in November, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
 But the heat the ocean had stored had to go somewhere: “It’s come out and been distributed around the world,” which helps explain record warm temperatures and wildfires in the Southern Hemisphere, Mr. Trenberth said.
 To get an idea of how much of the record heat is caused by El Niño and how much by global warming, Dr. Blunden said that scientists at NOAA compared this El Niño to the last strong one, in 1997-98, which was also record-setting for its warmth. This one has pushed past those records by raising global temperatures an additional 0.8 degree or so, Dr. Blunden said.
 The high temperatures in March probably signaled the last gasp of El Niño, and surface temperatures across the globe are likely to begin to fall this year. Often, El Niños are followed by La Niña storm systems, which can usher in cooler periods, Dr. Blunden said.
 But after more than two record-setting hot years — 2014 and 2015 and an extremely warm few months in 2016 — many of the devastating effects of the one-two punch of global warming and El Niño may be inescapable, setting the world on a course for an extended period of rapid global warming, after a period of relatively slow warming that began in 1998 and lasted for about a decade.
 Dr. Blunden said that the Arctic was seeing some of the most abnormal weather on earth, with temperatures about 6 degrees warmer than the average over all. These highs could lead to record melting of Arctic sea ice this summer; the ice cover is at its lowest since measurements began to be taken in the late 1970s.
 Dr. Trenberth said that these conditions did not represent “a new normal” and that it was difficult to determine the long-term consequences of this El Niño on both global temperatures and Arctic sea ice cover.
 He is not sure if 2016 will prove to be as warm as 2015 — “I’m betting it’s a tossup,” he said — but added that it’s not the record heat that comes as a shock.
 The magnitude of the jump “is indeed surprising,” Dr. Trenberth said.
 A central feature of the Paris climate agreement was to hold the increase in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels, and to try to limit the increase to about 1.5 degrees Celsius.
 As global temperatures are already nearing the 1.5-degree threshold, and some months have been about 1 degree or more above average, this goal might be difficult to achieve, Dr. Trenberth said.
 “I don’t see at all how we’re going to not go through the 1.5 degree-number in the next decade or so,” Dr. Trenberth added.

"PORTLAND, Ore. — Accompanied by a small crew of medical and support personnel, Stephen Curry arrived at Moda Center on Saturday afternoon about four hours before Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Golden State Warriors and the Portland Trail Blazers.
 Curry, the Warriors’ star guard, then played 2-on-2, the latest phase of his ongoing recovery from a right knee sprain. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr shared two observations. First, Curry carved up Chris DeMarco, a player development coach who was assigned to defend Curry. Second, Curry refused to pass the ball to his teammate, the assistant coach Jarron Collins.
 “But I wouldn’t, either,” Kerr said, deadpan, before adding: “He came out of it fine. It was his first actual basketball.”
 Given the Warriors’ long-term aspirations of repeating as N.B.A. champions, the game before the game was important — important because Curry appeared to be nearing a return, and even more important because the Warriors went on to absorb a 120-108 loss without him.
 While the Warriors have been able to survive and even thrive without Curry for much of the postseason, Saturday’s setback reinforced his value. The Warriors will take a two-games-to-one lead into Game 4 of the best-of-seven series here on Monday night, but the Trail Blazers regained their rhythm in Game 3, finally capitalizing on a chance to steal a win in Curry’s absence.
 In fairness, not even Curry’s shot-making pyrotechnics would have masked his team’s breakdowns. Damian Lillard collected 40 points and 10 assists for the Trail Blazers, who shot 17 of 30 from 3-point range. Al-Farouq Aminu, a rangy forward, added 23 points and shot 8 of 9 from the field. Coach Terry Stotts played three of his starters at least 41 minutes each.
 “We had to do everything to win this game,” Stotts said.
 Draymond Green had 37 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists for the Warriors, and Klay Thompson finished with 35 points. But Kerr said he felt that his players failed to move the ball, fouled too much and struggled in several other areas. He had a long list of lapses.
 Draymond Green scored 37 points for the Warriors, and Klay Thompson had 35. But Kerr said he felt that his team’s ball movement was stagnant, and he cited other problems.
 “We couldn’t get a loose ball or a rebound to save our lives,” Kerr said, adding, “I just didn’t feel like we played with the desperation that’s necessary to win a playoff game.”
 As if the series had not taken enough of a dramatic turn, Green went so far as to make a guarantee for Game 4.
 “We’ll win,” said Green, whose larynx might as well be a megaphone.
 After losing the first two games of the series in Oakland, Calif., the Trail Blazers found solace at home. The last time the Warriors visited Moda Center, on Feb. 19, the Trail Blazers blistered them, 137-105 — by far Golden State’s most lopsided loss of the regular season.
 The Trail Blazers also bounced back from a demoralizing loss on Tuesday in Game 2, when the Warriors outscored them by 22 points in the fourth quarter to turn an 11-point deficit into an 11-point win. The Trail Blazers came away feeling as if they had outplayed the Warriors for three quarters — at Oracle Arena, no less — until they let their momentum slip away.
 Before Saturday’s game, Kerr said his players had done a good job of adjusting to life without Curry. It is not ideal, of course. He will need to regain his timing and conditioning once he does return. But he appeared to come out of Saturday’s workout with his appendages intact, and Kerr said that Curry would most likely play some 3-on-3 at Sunday’s practice. His status for Monday’s game remained uncertain.
 Curry has not played since April 24, when he sprained his knee slipping on a wet spot on the floor in Game 4 of the Warriors’ first-round series against the Houston Rockets. The Warriors have not had reason to rush him back — not yet, anyway.
 On Saturday, with his team trailing at the end of the first quarter, Lillard went to Stotts with a request that sounded more like a demand. Lillard usually sits on the bench for the first five or six minutes of the second quarter, but he wanted to return earlier. Stotts was willing to oblige. There was no reason to exercise caution at this stage of the season.
 “It’s not going to be none of this, ‘You come out at this time or that time,’ ” Lillard said. “It was straight go-get-it mode.”
 Lillard delivered. His fifth 3-pointer gave Portland a 12-point lead late in the second quarter. Likewise, Thompson carried the Warriors, scoring 24 of his team’s 46 points in the first half.
 But Lillard got more help as the game wore on. Early in the third quarter, Gerald Henderson extended the Trail Blazers’ lead to 15 with a 3-pointer. Curry could only watch from the bench.
 “We challenged them,” Lillard said.
 REBOUNDS
 Steve Kerr, the coach of the Warriors, said he had a great deal of respect for Dave Joerger, who was fired on Saturday as coach of the Memphis Grizzlies. “It makes me a little nervous,” Kerr said, adding: “But I’ve said this many times: That’s why they pay us a lot of money. That’s part of the deal, and even winning doesn’t guarantee you employment. So you make the best of it. And when you’re on a good run like we are here, you enjoy it, because you know it doesn’t last long.”

"PARIS — Over the first 13 days of the European Championships, we saw 36 soccer games and 69 goals. We saw relatively good behavior on the field (only two red cards) and relatively bad behavior off the field (everything from flares to smoke to full-on, in-stadium fan attacks).
 On Wednesday, one of the great stories in sports kept rolling: Iceland, with a population roughly the size of Corpus Christi, Tex., beat Austria by 2-1 to advance to the round of 16. Estimates are that about 8 percent of Iceland’s 330,000 residents are in France for this, the country’s first major tournament, and the team’s run is, incredibly, not over yet.
 The group stage, however, has come to an end. And while it might seem strange that it took this long to whittle 24 teams down to 16, so it is, and so it was. Starting on Saturday, then, are the knockout rounds, but before they begin, here is a look at what has happened and what is yet to come.
 The minnows are still swimming
 It is not just Iceland making magic. Northern Ireland, Wales, Hungary and Ireland all advanced to the second stage of the tournament, which meant more than a quarter of the teams in the round of 16 could qualify as surprises.
 The less auspicious nations have not done it with smoke and mirrors, either: Northern Ireland beat Ukraine; Wales ran all over Group B; Hungary defeated Austria and tied Portugal; and Ireland capped the final match day by beating Italy, 1-0, on a late goal from Robbie Brady that sent the Irish through and their fans on to a party that does not figure to stop for quite some time.
 Scoring is still down
 If the fallback criticism for those who do not like soccer is that “no one ever scores,” this year’s group stage may be known in the future as Exhibit A. While the games have been good on balance — 20 goals were scored in the 76th minute or later, and seven came in stoppage time — the goals-per-game average of 1.92 has been the lowest at a World Cup or Euros since 1996. There have been three 0-0 draws and only two games with more than three goals (which made Wednesday’s 3-3 tie between Hungary and Portugal an outlier).
 Why the drop in goals? As is often the case, many explanations are possible, including a combination of poor weather and sloppy fields (much of France has been flooded); the ever-lengthening seasons for clubs, which sent hundreds of weary players to France; and, as many have speculated, the expansion to 24 teams, which watered down the talent and reduced the incentive to press for goals.
 Having four of the six third-place teams advance made things a bit weird … but also wild
 Here is something that does not happen very often: Albania finished its Group A round-robin on Sunday night. The team’s players and staff members then hung around northwestern France for three days until they learned, on Wednesday, that their tournament run was actually over. The results of the early games had rendered Albania’s 3 points and minus-2 goal-differential inferior to all its rivals for a third-place qualification spot. But at least they got a few extra days of practice.
 The Albanians’ experience was the downside to the tournament setup. The upside was the fast-changing scenarios that made the last day of matches fascinating. Consider this: In the space of just a few minutes on Wednesday, Portugal went from eliminated to facing England in the knockout stage to, after Iceland’s late goal against Austria, going up against Croatia this weekend instead.
 The bracket for the knockout rounds is remarkably top-heavy
 Or, if you prefer, side-heavy. Because of several unexpected results in the group stage, one side of the bracket now features England, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. The other side has a profile so much lower that even before a round-of-16 match has been played, we know that at least one of the finalists on July 10 will be a team that has never won a major tournament.
 So congratulations to Hungary, Switzerland, Poland, Croatia, Portugal, Wales, Northern Ireland and Belgium. One of you will have a chance to make some history.
 We are all Zlatan
 He would no doubt be upset to see this item so far down this list, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Swedish star who very much enjoys telling the world all about himself, made his last appearance for his national team on Wednesday when Sweden finished off a woeful tournament with a 1-0 loss to Belgium. Ibrahimovic is expected to continue his club career, most likely with Manchester United, but he announced this week that he planned to retire from international play after the Euros.
 It was not a particularly beautiful farewell; Ibrahimovic did not score in his team’s three games (two draws and a defeat).
 Some weird stuff happened. Really weird, actually.
 Russia almost got itself kicked out. Croatia’s fans almost blew up a security guard. Cristiano Ronaldo threw a reporter’s microphone into a lake. And Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon fell off a crossbar while celebrating. (No, seriously — here’s a closer look.)
 More to come after a short break
 After rest days on Thursday and Friday, the round of 16 begins with Switzerland facing Poland on Saturday. Wales and Northern Ireland also play Saturday. France faces Ireland on Sunday, and Spain goes against Italy on Monday. And don’t forget about England and Iceland. With the Copa América final mixed in on Sunday night, this weekend could be the pinnacle of a month of great soccer.

"Donald J. Trump has slipped markedly in polls against Hillary Clinton amid a cascading series of self-inflicted controversies, culminating with his heated call after last weekend’s massacre in Florida for a crackdown on Muslim immigration and for stricter scrutiny of Muslim communities in the United States.
 Pollsters caution that it is too soon to know the precise impact of Mr. Trump’s response to the attack in Orlando, Fla., in which a gunman declaring allegiance to the Islamic State killed dozens in a gay nightclub.
 But Mr. Trump has plainly faltered in his attempts to seize the upper hand over Mrs. Clinton at the start of the general election campaign. His fiery speeches targeting Muslims have discomfited Republican Party leaders in Washington, only days after elected officials in both parties chastised him for his denunciations of an Indiana-born federal judge for his “Mexican heritage.”
 Batting aside criticism from Democrats and other Republicans, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Trump has repeatedly since Monday offered a slashing critique of Muslims, including American citizens. He has argued, without evidence, that many Muslim communities in the United States had advance knowledge of terrorist attacks and declined to report them.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Trump renewed his call for surveillance of American Muslims. “We have to go and we have to check, respectfully, the mosques,” he said at a rally in Atlanta.
 Mr. Trump, who was effectively even with Mrs. Clinton after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May, has trailed by varying margins in the most recent round of polls.
 A CBS News poll conducted after the Orlando attack found that 51 percent of Americans disapproved of Mr. Trump’s response to the shootings, while only a quarter approved. Mrs. Clinton drew split marks for her response.
 Yet a poll by Bloomberg News also found that by a slim margin, voters said they would trust Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton to handle an Orlando-like attack a year from now.
 The Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, an adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump might yet tap into Americans’ unease about national security, and described the electorate as “frustrated and anxious about security issues.”
 “There’s no question that many Americans are ready for something other than standard political patter,” Mr. Newhouse said. But he added that Mr. Trump had gone “too far” with his conspiratorial language after Orlando.
 Former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a Republican who led the state after the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by domestic terrorists, said Mr. Trump had not met the traditional expectations of political leaders responding to violent events.
 “Frequently, Mr. Trump’s tone is hysterical, and there is simply no reason for that,” Mr. Keating said. “Leaders, whether they’re governors or presidents, need to make sure they don’t create a blood-lust hysteria.”
 Mr. Keating said that some of Mr. Trump’s ideas, like scrutinizing people who enter the country, were sound, but that he was unsure he could support the presumptive Republican nominee. In a crisis, he said, “The one thing you don’t do is shout fire in a crowded theater.”
 The stakes for Mr. Trump in how he responds to a national crisis may be higher than those for a more typical candidate. Having won the Republican nomination with a combative populist campaign, Mr. Trump entered the general election widely seen as a tempestuous figure with none of the conventional seasoning for the presidency.
 In polls, voters have consistently questioned whether he has the right temperament to be president, and he is intensely unpopular with most voting groups other than white men.
 Mrs. Clinton has sought to amplify voters’ concerns about Mr. Trump, describing him both before and after the Orlando attack as a loose cannon who lacks the judgment to be president.
 Campaigning along the Virginia coast on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton pilloried Mr. Trump for his “Twitter rants and conspiracy theories” and called his approach to national security entirely unserious.
 “Not one of Donald Trump’s reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,” she said.
 There have been scattered indications that Mr. Trump understands that he must, to some degree, adapt his approach for the general election. Even as he has publicly dismissed suggestions that he revise his policy proposals and campaign style, he has seemed, at times, to seek a wider audience for his message.
 In his speech in New Hampshire on Monday, while warning ominously about Muslim immigration, Mr. Trump also pitched himself as a champion of gay and lesbian Americans, whom he described as acutely menaced by the rise of radical Islam.
 While he did not abandon his call for a full stop to Muslim immigration to the United States, Mr. Trump described his proposal in somewhat more clinical language. Instead of explicitly demanding a religious test for all migrants, he said he would favor cutting off entry from countries with a history of exporting terrorism.
 And in a nod to the growing calls — from Democrats and a handful of Republicans — for new gun control measures, Mr. Trump said he would meet with National Rifle Association officials and reiterated his past support for restricting gun purchases by people on terrorism watch lists.
 Still, Mr. Trump’s anti-Muslim language and explosive personal style have overshadowed those comparatively modest concessions to mainstream politics. In the tenor of his speeches and his most consequential policy demands, he has hewed closely to the model of his insurgent primary campaign, in which he strung together victories by appealing to a zealous faction of the Republican base that applauded his rejection of political norms.
 Despite his comments over the last week, Mr. Trump is unlikely to lose any support from that constituency. In the general election, however, he must win over a much larger and more diverse collection of voters who have, so far, rejected his signature proposals.
 In the primaries, exit polling showed that strong majorities of Republican voters supported Mr. Trump’s suggested ban on Muslim immigrants. But in the CBS and Bloomberg News polls this week, more than three-fifths of voters said they either opposed the ban or were troubled by it.
 Professing indifference to the rebukes he has received from his own party, Mr. Trump said at his rally in Atlanta on Wednesday that Republican leaders should “be quiet” and support him, and raised the prospect of essentially running a one-man campaign if they do not.
 “Our leaders have to get tougher,” he said. “This is too tough to do it alone, but you know what? I think I’m going to be forced to.”
